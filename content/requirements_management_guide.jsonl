By maintaining alignment between stakeholder needs and the product being developed, it minimizes risks, enhances product quality, and drives project success.\n\nWhether you\u2019re new to requirements management, seeking to enhance your current process, or aiming to benchmark against industry leaders, this guide has you covered.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore what requirements management is, why it\u2019s essential, the key steps in the process, and how to effectively manage requirements for complex, highly regulated products.\n\n![A cycle of the steps of requirements management, including Gather Requirements, Analyze Requirements, Verify Requirements, Validate Requirements, Implement Requirements, and Monitor Requirements.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/What-is-Requirements-Management-1030x911.png)\n\n### What is a need?\n\nA need is an agreed-to expectation for a product or system to perform some function or possess some quality within specified constraints with acceptable risk.  Needs communicate what the stakeholders need and expect from a product or system in order for a given problem or opportunity to be addressed.\n\n### What is a requirement?\n\nA requirement is the result of a formal transformation of one or more needs or parent requirements into an agreed-to obligation for a product or system to perform some function or possess some quality within specified constraints with acceptable risk.\n\nThere are different types of needs and requirements that range from a business focus to a user focus to a technical focus.\n\nBusiness needs and requirements, sometimes referred to as stakeholder needs and requirements, are those derived from the business processes or elicited from the stakeholders including customers, users, and other stakeholders involved in the project. The stakeholder needs represent what the stakeholders need the product to do to address the problem or opportunity the product is to address; stakeholder requirements are stakeholder-defined product requirements that communicate what the stakeholders require of the product to meet their needs. Stakeholder needs are expressed in natural language without the use of \u201cshall\u201d, while stakeholder requirements are communicated with \u201cshall\u201d to make sure they are treated as binding requirements the product will be verified to meet.\n\nGiven there are multiple stakeholders, there will be multiple sets of stakeholder needs and requirements. It is up to the project team to elicit these needs and requirements, and resolve conflicts, inconsistencies, and other issues. The results will be an integrated set of needs from which the product requirements will be transformed. The resulting product requirements represents what the product must do in order for the needs to be met. Product requirements are sometimes referred to as system requirements, software requirements, or technical requirements.\n\n![what is a requirement, and why does it matter?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/jama-software-understanding-requirements-in-products.png)\n\n### What is requirements management?\n\nRequirements management is the process of gathering, analyzing, verifying, and validating the needs and requirements for the given product or system being developed. Successful requirements management ensures that completed deliverables meet the expectations of the stakeholders. Requirements can be managed using documents, however, complex systems or products in highly regulated industries mitigate risk by using trusted requirements management tools.\n\n### Why is requirements management important?\n\nRequirements management is important because it empowers everyone to clearly understand stakeholder expectations and confidently deliver a product that has been verified to meet the requirements and validated to meet the needs.\n\nRequirements management is a sophisticated process that includes many moving parts and diverse groups of people. Typically, the product management department, specifically the product manager, is responsible for the requirements management process. They work with the stakeholders, including business teams, customers, users, developers, testers, regulators, and quality assurance.\n\nAdditionally, a product may have only 100 requirements, or it may have several thousand. This number will depend on the product\u2019s complexity and level of regulation. With all these elements at play, success hinges on the ability to get everyone on the same page, working toward the same goal.\n\nTherefore, the business value of managing requirements is huge, as successful requirements management is key to project success. Benefits of requirements management include:\n\n- Enhance understanding of stakeholder needs, requirements, and expectations and the problem or opportunity the product means to address\n- Gain clarity on scope, budget, and schedule\n- Minimize costly, time-consuming rework\n- Increase product quality\n- Mitigate risk\n- Improve likelihood of delivering the right product, within budget and schedule with the required quality.\n\nThe importance of requirements management is intensified, however, when building complex or highly regulated products. This is because more time and budget are invested in development. The cost of getting it wrong \u2014 be it money, time, or reputation \u2014 is too great to risk. Hence, developers in regulated industries, or those who develop products with a lengthy list of needs and requirements, tend to rely on requirements management tools, like\u00a0[Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0to keep their projects in order.**\u00a0**\n\n![Why are requirements important to an organization?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/jama-connect-requirements-management-success-pyramid.png)\n\n#### Requirements management vs. project management\n\nWhile it may seem that requirements management and project management are synonymous, there is a difference. Simply, project management is getting the product built within budget and schedule with the available resources. Requirements management is making sure the product is the right product and that it is built right.\n\nThe goal of the product development process is to create a successful product that meets stakeholder, customer, and market needs. The requirements management piece of product development includes managing the needs and requirements so that the product meets stakeholder expectations. Therefore, needs and requirements along with budget and schedule set the scope for the project.\n\nHowever, the domain of project management encompasses tasks like providing budget, personnel, and resources needed to develop the product.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Modern tools like Jama Connect simplify collaboration, automate compliance, and improve traceability, helping you overcome common challenges.\n\n**Learn more and take control of your process: ****Four Stages of Requirements Management Processes**\n\n### Requirements development stage\n\nThe development stage is conducted using the organization\u2019s requirements analysis process.\n\nThe needs and requirements development stage includes eliciting needs and requirements from the identified stakeholders, properly defining and refining them, and analyzing them to ensure clarity and resolve issues and conflicts. Without successful needs and requirements development, there would very likely be gaps between what stakeholders were expecting and what is ultimately delivered, which could ultimately result in disaster.\n\n#### Eliciting needs and requirements\n\nNeeds and requirements elicitation \u2013 also called [needs and requirements gathering](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-gathering) \u2013 is the act of working with users, customers, and internal business stakeholders to identify stakeholder needs and requirements and get an understanding of the requirements for a product or system.\n\n#### Needs and requirements definition\n\nNeeds and requirements definition is the time when the gathered needs and requirements are re-written in a clear and traceable way that enables effective communication throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\nThere are many\u00a0[do\u2019s and don\u2019ts for writing needs and requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/8-dos-and-donts-for-writing-requirements/), but the following are basic\u00a0[characteristics of quality needs and requirements](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/best-practices-guide-for-writing-requirements):\n\n- Necessary\n- Unambiguous\n- Feasible\n- Verifiable\n- Correct\n- Traceable\n- Appropriate\n\nTraceability of needs and requirements is very important. At the end of the day, [traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/) is the only way to know if a need or requirement has been fulfilled by the design and the built product. Bi-directional traceability\u2014the ability to perform both forward and backward traceability, usually made possible via requirements management tools like *Jama Connect*\u2014allows teams to understand why a specific need or requirement exists and\u00a0[easily analyze the impact of change](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/change-impact-analysis-2/)s.\n\nFurthermore, products in\u00a0[regulated industries must demonstrate traceability to prove compliance](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/highly-regulated-industries-need-modern-requirements-management/)\u00a0with standards and regulations. Therefore, when writing requirements, it\u2019s paramount that each requirement maps to all corresponding artifacts.\n\nMany teams use a requirements traceability matrix (RTM) to track requirements and manage the scope of a requirements change. The RTM is static and maintained manually. The problem is that change is ubiquitous in the product development process. When change happens, teams must manually search the RTM document for all related upstream and downstream needs and requirements, dependent requirements, and verification and validation tests that may be affected by the change.\n\nScouring through an excel spreadsheet for each change may not be that daunting if there are only one hundred or so needs and requirements. However, if the product has hundreds or thousands of needs and requirements\u2014think complex, regulated products\u2014managing the scope of change becomes a cumbersome and time-draining exercise fraught with risk.\n\nRequirements management tools are designed to streamline the process\u2014even for highly complex, regulated products. Jama Connect, specifically, uses the\u00a0[benefits of Live Traceabilty\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability)\u00a0to:\n\n- Easily determine the impact of change\n- Automate compliance\n- Enable end-to-end process improvement\n- Increase productivity\n- Reduce product risk\n- Increase quality\n\n#### Requirements analysis\n\nSometimes, there is a gap between what stakeholders say they want and what they actually want. The purpose of requirements analysis is to ensure all business, software, and product requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and requirements. The goal of requirements analysis is to get a clear understanding of stakeholder needs so the deliverable matches stakeholder expectations.\n\n#### System Verification Stage\n\nSystem verification means determining if the finished product meets the baselined product requirements. This is different than system validation (discussed below), which evaluates whether the product satisfies the stakeholder needs. Both are important, but system verification always comes first.\n\nPlanning for this stage starts when the product requirements are being defined. Planning includes determining which system verification events are needed to confirm that product requirements are fulfilled.\n\nTo ensure successful system verification, the following attributes should be defined for each product requirement before the requirements are baseline.\n\n- Success criteria (what must be proven to show the requirement was met)\n- Method (test, demonstration, inspection, or analysis)\n- Strategy (approach to be used, operating environment, test environment, system configuration, etc.)\n\nDefining these attributes sets the expectations for the [test and quality assurance](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/) work that needs to be done, and reduces the risk of rework down the line.\n\n#### System Validation Stage\n\nSystem validation means determining whether the product satisfies its established stakeholder needs. Successful system validation is what leads to acceptance of the product for its intended use by its intended users in the actual operational environment. For highly regulated products, approval for use is dependent upon successful system validation. \u00a0Final product acceptance by a customer also depends on successful system validation.\n\nPlanning for system validation starts when the integrated set of needs are being defined.\u00a0 Planning includes, determining which system validation events are needed to confirm that needs are fulfilled. One approach is to define a set of attributes that address system validation for each need.\n\nTo ensure successful system validation, the following attributes should be defined for each need before the needs are baselined.\n\n- Success criteria (what must be proven to show the need was met)\n- Method (test, demonstration, inspection, or analysis)\n- Strategy (approach to be used, operating environment, test environment, system configuration, etc.)\n\nDefining these attributes sets the expectations for the [test and quality assurance](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/) work that needs to be done, and reduces the risk of rework down the line.\n\n### Challenges with requirements management\n\n[Requirements management has its share of challenges.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/10-product-development-challenges-engineers-face/) One such challenge is change management. Because change is so prevalent in the requirements management process, teams need to address how they will manage change at the beginning of the project.\n\nWhen building products that have thousands of requirements and countless changes, teams can spend hours circulating, editing, and tracking changes in an attempt to maintain traceability and simply keep development on track.\n\nThis is especially challenging when maintaining the needs and requirements in document form. Version control issues are one challenge that results from change. Versioning problems can arise on the artifact itself. For example, someone might be giving feedback on SRS version one but there is already an SRS version two with different, additional edits. What\u2019s more, version control can be even more granular within the document as well. For example, requirement one might be on version three, which is linked to test B on version two.\n\nAdd to that consolidating feedback from multiple stakeholders via email or meetings, analyzing the impact of change across various versions of requirements artifacts, and communicating the correct changes and statuses to the right people. It\u2019s a nightmare just thinking about how to keep it all straight.\n\nThe following are the\u00a0[top five challenges of requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/conquering-the-5-biggest-challenges-of-requirements-management-part-i/):\n\n- Last-minute feedback\n- Decision rehashing\n- Change tax\n- Attention deficit\n- Mismatched expectations\n\nIt\u2019s easy to recognize that problems are compounded when managing requirements using documents \u2013 or legacy systems based on documents \u2013 instead of a purpose-built requirements management tool. Most of these challenges, and more, can be overcome by switching from a document-centric to a data-centric approach to requirements management to one that is data-centric.\n\n### How to successfully manage requirements in complex products and highly regulated industries\n\nThe challenges above are real and mastering them can have significant impact on development timelines and budget. Developers in regulated industries \u2014 like\u00a0[automotive](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/automotive),\u00a0[aerospace](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/airborne-systems/),\u00a0[medical device](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/medical-device/),\u00a0[government](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/government), and\u00a0[industrial manufacturing\u00a0](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/industrial-manufacturing/)\u2014 are further challenged by the need to prove compliance with regulations and standards.\n\nStandards and regulations can be sources of hundreds of requirements with which a product must comply. Often, not all of the requirements in a regulation or standard apply to your specific product. Standards and regulations contain requirements not only for products, but also requirements concerning system verification and system validation (acceptance, certification, and qualification), and requirements. On the organization developing the product, as well. In addition, requirements within standards and regulations are often poorly written and ambiguous.\n\nWhen identifying drivers and constraints at the beginning of the project, the project team needs to identify all applicable standards and regulations which requirements within those standards and regulations actually apply to their specific product. Then, they must write well-formed product requirements to address the intent of those regulatory requirements, such that the product will result compliant with the applicable standards and regulations.\n\nRegulations are not requirements. Requirements must be written to adequately satisfy the regulatory standards. A keen understanding of applicable standards and regulations is paramount in writing requirements that will lead to a product\u2019s compliance. Once written, a regulatory requirement should be attributed as such in all requirements artifacts. This can be done be assigning a \u201ccompliance\u201d attribute. This provides all team members visibility throughout development, which assists with decision making and change analysis.\n\nIn addition to expert knowledge of the standards and regulations, the following are needed to maintain product compliance when building a product:\n\n- Collaboration between teams\n- Single source of truth for defining, verifying, and validating compliance requirements\n- Standard frameworks aligned to standards and regulations\n- Traceability across all development activities and resulting artifacts.\n- Simplified audit preparation and data exports\n\nReporting is key when faced with a compliance audit. Teams must know what data is required for the audit and how to easily access it when needed. Often, audit trails are an afterthought in which teams are scrambling to pull together data from several sources. This is a dangerous practice, though, because it can put delivery timelines and launch deadlines at risk. It can even put the launch at risk of failing altogether. Teams that must demonstrate compliance, must eliminate this risk with a detailed, digital audit trail that can be easily exported whenever needed. Establishing and managing traceability is critical to maintaining the audit trail.\n\nMany leaders in regulated industries rely on requirements management tools to reduce the risk of failure to comply with standards and regulations during the product development process. Jama Connect, for example, can track standards and regulations and compliance when building products. These industry leaders leverage Jama Connect to keep them at the forefront of innovation:\n\n- [Arteris IP manages complexities of autonomous vehicle development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-arteris-ip-leverages-jama-connect-for-autonomous-vehicle-development/)\n- [Spaceflight brings the high costs of doing business in space down to Earth](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/aerospace-and-defense-customer-stories/spaceflight-customer-story)\n- [Infineon transitions from a document-centric to data-centric development flow](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/jama-software-infineon-customer-story)\n- [3Shape is changing the shape of dentistry](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/how-3shape-is-changing-dentistry-with-jama-connect)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)\n\n### Benefits of requirements management tools\n\n- The advantages of RM tools are many.

The stakeholder needs represent what the stakeholders need the product to do to address the problem or opportunity the product is to address; stakeholder requirements are stakeholder-defined product requirements that communicate what the stakeholders require of the product to meet their needs. Stakeholder needs are expressed in natural language without the use of \u201cshall\u201d, while stakeholder requirements are communicated with \u201cshall\u201d to make sure they are treated as binding requirements the product will be verified to meet.\n\nGiven there are multiple stakeholders, there will be multiple sets of stakeholder needs and requirements. It is up to the project team to elicit these needs and requirements, and resolve conflicts, inconsistencies, and other issues. The results will be an integrated set of needs from which the product requirements will be transformed. The resulting product requirements represents what the product must do in order for the needs to be met. Product requirements are sometimes referred to as system requirements, software requirements, or technical requirements.\n\n![what is a requirement, and why does it matter?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/jama-software-understanding-requirements-in-products.png)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is requirements management?", "level": 3, "content": "Requirements management is the process of gathering, analyzing, verifying, and validating the needs and requirements for the given product or system being developed.

Typically, the product management department, specifically the product manager, is responsible for the requirements management process. They work with the stakeholders, including business teams, customers, users, developers, testers, regulators, and quality assurance.\n\nAdditionally, a product may have only 100 requirements, or it may have several thousand. This number will depend on the product\u2019s complexity and level of regulation. With all these elements at play, success hinges on the ability to get everyone on the same page, working toward the same goal.\n\nTherefore, the business value of managing requirements is huge, as successful requirements management is key to project success. Benefits of requirements management include:\n\nThe importance of requirements management is intensified, however, when building complex or highly regulated products. This is because more time and budget are invested in development. The cost of getting it wrong \u2014 be it money, time, or reputation \u2014 is too great to risk. Hence, developers in regulated industries, or those who develop products with a lengthy list of needs and requirements, tend to rely on requirements management tools, like\u00a0[Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0to keep their projects in order.**\u00a0**\n\n![Why are requirements important to an organization?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/jama-connect-requirements-management-success-pyramid.png)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Requirements management vs. project management", "level": 4, "content": "While it may seem that requirements management and project management are synonymous, there is a difference.

The requirements management piece of product development includes managing the needs and requirements so that the product meets stakeholder expectations. Therefore, needs and requirements along with budget and schedule set the scope for the project.\n\nHowever, the domain of project management encompasses tasks like providing budget, personnel, and resources needed to develop the product.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Ready to Find Out More?", "level": 3, "content": "Our team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

At the end of the day, [traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/) is the only way to know if a need or requirement has been fulfilled by the design and the built product. Bi-directional traceability\u2014the ability to perform both forward and backward traceability, usually made possible via requirements management tools like *Jama Connect*\u2014allows teams to understand why a specific need or requirement exists and\u00a0[easily analyze the impact of change](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/change-impact-analysis-2/)s.\n\nFurthermore, products in\u00a0[regulated industries must demonstrate traceability to prove compliance](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/highly-regulated-industries-need-modern-requirements-management/)\u00a0with standards and regulations. Therefore, when writing requirements, it\u2019s paramount that each requirement maps to all corresponding artifacts.\n\nMany teams use a requirements traceability matrix (RTM) to track requirements and manage the scope of a requirements change. The RTM is static and maintained manually. The problem is that change is ubiquitous in the product development process. When change happens, teams must manually search the RTM document for all related upstream and downstream needs and requirements, dependent requirements, and verification and validation tests that may be affected by the change.\n\nScouring through an excel spreadsheet for each change may not be that daunting if there are only one hundred or so needs and requirements. However, if the product has hundreds or thousands of needs and requirements\u2014think complex, regulated products\u2014managing the scope of change becomes a cumbersome and time-draining exercise fraught with risk.\n\nRequirements management tools are designed to streamline the process\u2014even for highly complex, regulated products.

This is different than system validation (discussed below), which evaluates whether the product satisfies the stakeholder needs. Both are important, but system verification always comes first.\n\nPlanning for this stage starts when the product requirements are being defined. Planning includes determining which system verification events are needed to confirm that product requirements are fulfilled.\n\nTo ensure successful system verification, the following attributes should be defined for each product requirement before the requirements are baseline.\n\nDefining these attributes sets the expectations for the [test and quality assurance](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/) work that needs to be done, and reduces the risk of rework down the line.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "System Validation Stage", "level": 4, "content": "System validation means determining whether the product satisfies its established stakeholder needs.

Because change is so prevalent in the requirements management process, teams need to address how they will manage change at the beginning of the project.\n\nWhen building products that have thousands of requirements and countless changes, teams can spend hours circulating, editing, and tracking changes in an attempt to maintain traceability and simply keep development on track.\n\nThis is especially challenging when maintaining the needs and requirements in document form. Version control issues are one challenge that results from change. Versioning problems can arise on the artifact itself. For example, someone might be giving feedback on SRS version one but there is already an SRS version two with different, additional edits. What\u2019s more, version control can be even more granular within the document as well. For example, requirement one might be on version three, which is linked to test B on version two.\n\nAdd to that consolidating feedback from multiple stakeholders via email or meetings, analyzing the impact of change across various versions of requirements artifacts, and communicating the correct changes and statuses to the right people. It\u2019s a nightmare just thinking about how to keep it all straight.\n\nThe following are the\u00a0[top five challenges of requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/conquering-the-5-biggest-challenges-of-requirements-management-part-i/):\n\nIt\u2019s easy to recognize that problems are compounded when managing requirements using documents \u2013 or legacy systems based on documents \u2013 instead of a purpose-built requirements management tool. Most of these challenges, and more, can be overcome by switching from a document-centric to a data-centric approach to requirements management to one that is data-centric.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How to successfully manage requirements in complex products and highly regulated industries", "level": 3, "content": "The challenges above are real and mastering them can have significant impact on development timelines and budget. Developers in regulated industries \u2014 like\u00a0[automotive](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/automotive),\u00a0[aerospace](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/airborne-systems/),\u00a0[medical device](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/medical-device/),\u00a0[government](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/government), and\u00a0[industrial manufacturing\u00a0](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/industrial-manufacturing/)\u2014 are further challenged by the need to prove compliance with regulations and standards.\n\nStandards and regulations can be sources of hundreds of requirements with which a product must comply. Often, not all of the requirements in a regulation or standard apply to your specific product. Standards and regulations contain requirements not only for products, but also requirements concerning system verification and system validation (acceptance, certification, and qualification), and requirements. On the organization developing the product, as well. In addition, requirements within standards and regulations are often poorly written and ambiguous.\n\nWhen identifying drivers and constraints at the beginning of the project, the project team needs to identify all applicable standards and regulations which requirements within those standards and regulations actually apply to their specific product. Then, they must write well-formed product requirements to address the intent of those regulatory requirements, such that the product will result compliant with the applicable standards and regulations.\n\nRegulations are not requirements. Requirements must be written to adequately satisfy the regulatory standards. A keen understanding of applicable standards and regulations is paramount in writing requirements that will lead to a product\u2019s compliance. Once written, a regulatory requirement should be attributed as such in all requirements artifacts. This can be done be assigning a \u201ccompliance\u201d attribute. This provides all team members visibility throughout development, which assists with decision making and change analysis.\n\nIn addition to expert knowledge of the standards and regulations, the following are needed to maintain product compliance when building a product:\n\nReporting is key when faced with a compliance audit. Teams must know what data is required for the audit and how to easily access it when needed. Often, audit trails are an afterthought in which teams are scrambling to pull together data from several sources. This is a dangerous practice, though, because it can put delivery timelines and launch deadlines at risk. It can even put the launch at risk of failing altogether. Teams that must demonstrate compliance, must eliminate this risk with a detailed, digital audit trail that can be easily exported whenever needed. Establishing and managing traceability is critical to maintaining the audit trail.\n\nMany leaders in regulated industries rely on requirements management tools to reduce the risk of failure to comply with standards and regulations during the product development process. Jama Connect, for example, can track standards and regulations and compliance when building products.

Numerous industry studies, however, indicate that requirements issues are a pervasive cause of project distress. The often-quoted CHAOS Reports from The Standish Group indicate that three of the biggest contributors to projects that fail or are \u201cchallenged\u201d are lack of user input, incomplete requirements and specifications, and changing requirements and specifications.\n\n### Why Do You Need Requirements Management? An Economic Argument\n\nThe case for implementing better requirements practices is an economic or business argument, not a philosophical or technical position. Think about how your company\u2019s bottom line is affected by requirements-related problems. Then use that understanding to justify investing in better requirements practices that can pay off for the long term.\n\nA recent case study of requirements failure was the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s new case management software system, called VCF. This project was abandoned after $170 million had been spent because the delivered software was full of defects and off-target functionality. As one investigator wrote:\n\n*I suspect what happened with the VCF is that in the rush to put in place a system, you think you got your requirements nailed, but you really don\u2019t. It was a classic case of not getting the requirements sufficiently defined in terms of completeness and correctness from the beginning. And so it required a continuous redefinition of requirements that had a cascading effect on what had already been designed and produced.\u00a0*(Goldstein, Harry. 2005. \u201cWho Killed the Virtual Case File?\u201d\u00a0*IEEE Spectrum*\u00a042(9): 24\u201335).\n\nNumerous studies have examined the effects of errors in requirements on software projects. They consistently find that nearly half of the discovered defects originated as requirement errors. The typical outcome of errors in the requirements is an expectation gap, a difference between what developers build and what customers really need. Clearly, any domain that is the root cause of approximately half of the problems on software projects deserves our attention.\n\nThe main reason errors in requirements are so damaging is that they force the development team to perform extensive rework to correct the errors. It\u2019s well-established that the cost of correcting a software error increases dramatically the later it is discovered, as shown in Table 1. An error, omission, or misunderstanding in the requirements forces developers to redo all the work they\u2019ve already done based on the incorrect requirement. Therefore, any technique that can reduce requirement defects and prevent some of this wasted effort is a high-leverage investment indeed. One analysis of the potential return on investment from better requirements suggested that requirement errors can consume between 70 and 85 percent of all project rework costs.\n\n#### Table 1. Relative Cost to Correct a Requirement Error\n\n| Stage Error Is Discovered | Relative Cost to Correct |\n| --- | --- |\n| Requirements Development | 1X |\n| Design | 2\u20133X |\n| Construction | 5\u201310X |\n| System or Acceptance Test | 8\u201320X |\n| Operation | 68\u2013110X |\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Management Tools and Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\n### What Better Requirements Can Do for You\n\nIn addition to avoiding some of the negative consequences described above, better software requirements provide numerous benefits. These include selecting the right projects to fund, facilitating estimation, enabling rational prioritization, developing higher quality designs, and testing more effectively.\n\n**Selecting projects to fund.\u00a0**Good preliminary requirements enable senior managers to make effective business decisions as organizations decide which among a set of potential projects to fund. Better requirements allow more accurate projection of business returns. Once a project is funded, better requirements allow project managers to more sensibly partition tasks among their teams and even among individual team members.\n\n**Facilitating estimation.\u00a0**Well-understood requirements can help your team estimate the effort and resources needed to execute a project. Reliable estimation requires some historical correlation between requirements size and effort.\n\n**Enabling prioritization.\u00a0**Documented requirements allow the team to prioritize its remaining work. Most projects need to make compromises to ensure that they implement the most critical and most timely functionality. A prioritized requirements baseline helps the team incorporate those changes that will deliver the maximum customer value. One study revealed that just 54 percent of the originally defined features were delivered on an average project. If you can\u2019t implement all of the requested functionality, make sure the team implements the right portion.\n\n**Developing designs.\u00a0**Requirements are the foundation for design. Therefore, well-understood and well-communicated requirements help developers devise the most appropriate solution to the problem. High-quality requirements also ensure that the development team works on the right problem. Many developers have experienced the frustration of implementing functionality that someone swore they needed, only to find that no one ever used it. One survey indicated that fully 45 percent of the delivered software product features were\u00a0*never*\u00a0used. Wasting less time implementing the wrong functionality accelerates the project and maximizes its business return.\n\n**Testing effectively.\u00a0**Well-defined and testable requirements allow testers to develop accurate test procedures to verify the functionality. Prioritizing requirements tells testers which ones to concentrate on first. Assessing requirement difficulty and risk helps testers know which functionality should receive the closest scrutiny.\n\n**Tracking project status.\u00a0**A comprehensive, traced set of requirements helps the stakeholders know when the project is done. A body of work is complete when all of the requirements allocated to it are either verified as being correctly implemented in the product or deleted from the baseline. Defined business requirements also allow the stakeholders to determine whether the project has met its goals.\n\n**Accelerating development.\u00a0**Believe it or not, investing more effort in developing the requirements can actually accelerate software development. This seems counterintuitive, but it\u2019s true. Defining business requirements\u2014the expected business outcomes the product will provide\u2014aligns the stakeholders with shared vision, goals, and expectations. Effective user involvement in establishing the requirements reduces the chance that users will reject the new system upon delivery. Following are some published illustrations.\n\n- In a study of 15 banking and telecommunications projects, the most successful projects spent 28 percent of their resources on requirements engineering, whereas the average project in the study devoted just 15.7 percent of its effort to requirements.\n- Increasing the fraction of the total budget devoted to requirements on a group of NASA projects led to substantially lower overrun of both cost and schedules; see Table 2 (Hooks, Ivy F., and Kristin A. Farry. 2001.\u00a0*Customer-Centered Products: Creating Successful Products Through Smart Requirements Management*. New York: AMACOM).\n- In a European survey, the fastest project teams spent about twice as much of their schedule (17 percent versus nine percent) and effort (14 percent versus seven percent) on requirements activities as the slower teams.\n\nTable 2. Cost and Schedule Overruns on Some NASA Projects\n\n| Percent of Budget Spent on Requirements | Number of Projects | Average Project Cost Overrun |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| < 5% | 5 | 125% |\n| 5 to 10% | 7 | 83% |\n| > 10% | 6 | 30% |\n\nAccurate requirements ensure that the functionality built will let users perform their essential business tasks. The requirements also establish achievable quality expectations. This lets the team implement both the capabilities and the product characteristics\u2014the nonfunctional requirements\u2014that will make users happy. Additionally, emphasizing requirements development is cheaper than relying on beta testing to find requirements problems. Fixing problems that late in the game is far costlier than correcting them earlier.\n\n*Jama Software has partnered with Karl Wiegers to share licensed content from his books and articles on our web site via a series of blog posts, whitepapers and webinars.\u00a0 Karl Wiegers is an independent consultant and not an employee of Jama. \u00a0He can be reached at\u00a0http://www.processimpact.com.\u00a0 Enjoy these free\u00a0requirements management resources.*\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss the Benefits of Modern Requirements Management\n\nDEFINITION OF REQUIREMENTS GATHERING:\n\n**Requirements Gathering ** is the process of understanding what you are trying to build and why you are building it.\n\nPREVIOUSWhat is Requirements Management?\n\nNEXT UPFour Stages of Requirements Management Processes\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

Without it, teams risk miscommunication, scope creep, and costly rework that can derail timelines and budgets. A structured approach ensures that evolving requirements are managed consistently, leading to a higher-quality product that meets stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe process can be broken into four key stages: planning, development, verification, and validation. Change management is not a separate stage but a continuous activity throughout the lifecycle, ensuring all requirements remain traceable and adaptable.\n\n**TL;DR:** Mastering these four stages helps you build the right product, the right way.\n\n#### Question: How mature is your current requirements management process?\n\n![Colorful circle graph showing a loop of the four stages of the requirements management process; planning stage, development stage, system verification, and system validation.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Four-Stages-Requirements-Management-Processes--1030x719.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Management Tools and Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\n### Stage 1: The Planning Stage\n\nThe planning stage sets the foundation for the entire project. This is where you define the rules of engagement for how your team will handle requirements from start to finish. The development methodology your team uses\u2014be it Waterfall, Agile, or a hybrid approach\u2014will heavily influence how requirements flow through the subsequent stages.\n\nA key deliverable of this stage is the **Requirements Management Plan (RMP)**. This document is the roadmap for your project and outlines:\n\n- Stakeholder roles and responsibilities.\n- The types of requirements artifacts to be created (e.g., use cases, design documents).\n- How traceability will be established and maintained.\n- The process for creating and managing baselines.\n- The strategy for managing changes to requirements.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Gaining stakeholder buy-in on the RMP is crucial. It aligns expectations and provides a clear path forward for everyone involved. Another critical part of planning is defining a **requirements baseline**\u2014a snapshot of agreed-upon requirements that marks the start of formal change control.\n\n### Stage 2: The Development Stage\n\nThe development stage is where requirements are brought to life. This phase focuses on eliciting, defining, and analyzing the needs of all stakeholders to provide the development team with a clear and unambiguous set of instructions.\n\nKey activities in this stage include:\n\n- **Eliciting Needs and Requirements:** Work directly with customers, users, and internal stakeholders to gather their expectations for the product using techniques like interviews, workshops, and surveys.\n- **Defining Needs and Requirements:** Translate gathered needs into clear, concise, and testable requirements. A high-quality requirement must be necessary, unambiguous, feasible, and verifiable.\n- **Requirements Analysis:** Analyze, negotiate, and resolve any conflicting or unclear requirements to ensure the final set accurately reflects the project\u2019s goals.\n\n**The most important part of this stage is establishing bi-directional traceability.** This allows teams to see how a change to one requirement might impact others, as well as associated tests and design elements. This is especially critical in regulated industries where proving compliance is mandatory.\n\n### Stage 3: The System Verification Stage\n\nSystem verification answers the question: **\u201cDid we build the product right?\u201d** This stage involves a series of tests and evaluations to confirm that the finished product meets the technical specifications and requirements defined in the baseline. Verification always comes before validation.\n\nTo ensure success, planning for verification should begin as the requirements are being written. For each product requirement, you should define:\n\n- **Success Criteria:** What is the measurable outcome that proves the requirement has been met?\n- **Method:** How will you verify it? Common methods include tests, demonstrations, inspections, or analyses.\n- **Strategy:** What is the approach, including the environment and system configuration needed for testing?\n\nDefining these attributes early sets clear expectations for the test and quality assurance teams and helps reduce the risk of discovering major issues late in the development cycle.\n\n### Stage 4: The System Validation Stage\n\nWhile verification checks against specifications, system validation answers a more fundamental question: **\u201cDid we build the right product?\u201d** The goal here is to determine if the product fulfills its intended purpose and meets the original stakeholder needs in a real-world operational environment.\n\n**Key takeaway:** Successful validation leads to user acceptance and, in regulated industries, official approval for use. Similar to verification, planning for validation should begin as soon as the initial stakeholder needs are defined, ensuring the end product not only works as designed but also solves the problem it was created to address.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark/)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Teams often struggle with last-minute feedback, decision rehashing, and mismatched stakeholder expectations. These problems are often magnified when teams rely on static documents like spreadsheets and Word files to manage requirements. Version control becomes a nightmare, and maintaining traceability across thousands of requirements is nearly impossible.\n\nThis is where modern [requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/) make a significant difference. Platforms like Jama Connect\u00ae provide a centralized, data-centric approach to managing the entire process. By moving away from static documents, teams can:\n\n- **Improve Traceability:** [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability/) offers a real-time, bi-directional view of all requirements, [tests](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/), and related artifacts, making impact analysis simple and instant.\n- **Streamline Collaboration:** Teams can collaborate in real-time, capturing discussions and decisions in context, which eliminates the need to hunt through emails and meeting notes.\n- **Automate Compliance:** For teams in regulated industries, Jama Connect can simplify audit preparation by generating comprehensive compliance reports and maintaining a detailed digital audit trail automatically.\n- **Manage Change Effectively:** When a requirement changes, the impact on upstream and downstream items is immediately visible, allowing teams to make informed decisions quickly.\n\n![Graphic of a bridge with elements representing a bridge of modern requirements management - improve traceability, streamline collaboration, automate compliance, and manage change effectively - and how requirements management challenges become effective when you implement Jama Connect.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Overcoming-Common-Process-Challenges--1030x741.png)\n\n### FAQs\n\n#### Q1: What is the most important stage in the requirements management process?\n\nWhile all four stages are critical for success, the Planning Stage is arguably the most foundational. A well-thought-out plan, including a comprehensive RMP and a clear baseline, prevents many of the common issues that derail projects later on.\n\n#### Q2: What is the difference between system verification and system validation?\n\nVerification asks, \u201cDid we build the product right?\u201d It checks if the product meets its technical specifications. Validation asks, \u201cDid we build the right product?\u201d It confirms if the product meets the actual needs of the stakeholders in its intended environment.\n\n#### Q3: How can a tool improve our requirements management process?\n\nA dedicated tool like Jama Connect replaces error-prone documents with a centralized platform. This improves collaboration, provides live traceability to manage complexity, automates compliance documentation, and gives teams the visibility needed to manage change effectively.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Why Investing in Requirements Management During an Economic Downturn Makes Good Business Sense](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/why-investing-in-requirements-management-during-an-economic-downturn-makes-good-business-sense/)\n\n### Take Control of Your Requirements Management Process\n\nA well-defined requirements management process is not just about documentation; it is about communication, collaboration, and control.

This makes the documentation process time-consuming and potentially risky. In this chapter, we examine how to take an Agile approach to requirements management.\n\nExisting approaches to requirements management (RM) aren\u2019t always flexible enough to meet stringent expectations and provide a single source of truth. Everyone involved with a project requires maximum visibility to understand what you\u2019re building \u2013 and why.\n\nOne study found that the majority of design teams admit that they don\u2019t have a requirements management system in place, and instead rely on cumbersome emails and shared documents. Furthermore, only 15% of teams surveyed had invested in a dedicated RM solution.\n\nTeams that are frustrated with rework, feeling stuck in unproductive collaboration and not moving as fast as they could benefit from adopting an Agile approach to requirements management.\n\n### What is an agile approach to requirements management?\n\nThere isn\u2019t a commonly agreed upon definition of agile requirements management or a single set of processes that will automatically make you agile if you implement it. However, there are concepts, processes and tools that support an agile approach to requirements management.\n\nThe foundation of an agile approach to requirements management is rooted in flexibility. Flexibility means you can easily iterate and make changes, so that you end up with a more accurate outcome and avoid off-target deliveries and missed deadlines.\n\nAgile requirements gathering is focused on developing the product faster while addressing customers\u2019 needs more accurately. Collaboration is critical; everyone on the team must have a firm understanding of the customer\u2019s true needs and how they affect RM.\n\nIn contrast, teams that don\u2019t use agile requirements are susceptible to unproductive work time, a lengthy review process, excessive rework, and even serious defects in the released product.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 Does My Data Model Matter?](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-does-my-data-model-matter)\n\n### How does agile requirements management outperform the alternatives?\n\nAgile requirements management\u00a0is focused heavily on action.\u00a0With agile, you create a flexible framework upfront, so\u00a0product\u00a0implementation\u00a0is\u00a0faster and more accurate. In contrast,\u00a0other approaches, such as the\u00a0waterfall approach, have\u00a0less flexibility and\u00a0are\u00a0built on a\u00a0rigid\u00a0foundation.\u00a0But why?\n\nThe waterfall\u00a0approach uses a V-shaped development process. The steps involved with coding, such as discovery,\u00a0[requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-engineering/), system engineering and\u00a0architecture, are performed in a specific order. You can\u2019t move to the next step until you\u2019ve finished the one before it. Once coding is complete, you continue to move through the\u00a0next processes in a\u00a0specific and\u00a0inflexible\u00a0order.\n\nThe strategy behind this approach is that you do as much work as possible upfront, and any\u00a0decisions\u00a0made during the early project stages are adhered to closely, without much room for change.\u00a0Moreover, requirements and design often\u00a0don\u2019t\u00a0go through testing until the end stages of the development process, so any\u00a0potential\u00a0changes show up late in the development cycle, and therefore are more time-consuming to fix.\n\nAgile requirements\u00a0management\u00a0is built on the principle of flexibility, so\u00a0any potential challenges are\u00a0identified\u00a0and resolved much earlier in the\u00a0process,\u00a0minimizing\u00a0expensive and costly rework. A few benefits of the agile approach include:\n\n- **Improved product design and delivery.**\u00a0A recent\u00a0[report](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-best-requirements-management-solution/)\u00a0suggests that best-in-class RM solutions can\u00a0significantly\u00a0improve product design and delivery for\u00a0agile\u00a0development teams.\u00a0\u201cIn the face of increasing regulations, connected products for the internet of things (IoT), and scaling Agile practices, AD&D [application development and delivery] leaders long for something to bring traceability and auditability to their processes without sacrificing speed.\u201d\n- **Improved traceability.**\u00a0The right RM solution can enhance development transparency through\u00a0[traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/requirements-traceability/).\u00a0Traceability\u00a0empowers\u00a0teams to\u00a0perform\u00a0impact analysis more readily, which is critical to product development.\n- **Achieve\u00a0quicker time to market.**\u00a0Teams are facing more\u00a0complexity\u00a0and pressure to comply with industry regulations, and need to measure customer value to\u00a0search, track and connect interdependent requirements.\u00a0Achieving\u00a0faster time to\u00a0market\u00a0requires that teams\u00a0collaborate\u00a0faster\u00a0and\u00a0more\u00a0effectively, working to build\u00a0traceability\u00a0requirements and test cases.\n\nAs you work to understand how an agile approach to requirements management benefits\u00a0your team and customer, it also helps to have a basic understanding\u00a0of the\u00a0agile requirements\u00a0lifecycle and how it works.\n\n### Designing with greater flexibility through theagile requirementsmanagement lifecycle\n\nThe agile requirements management lifecycle is focused on\u00a0clearly defining a\u00a0project\u2019s scope, so that you better understand what needs to happen to meet the desired end goal. It provides a\u00a0high-level\u00a0understanding of business goals, and outlines what is needed for the project to be a success. Consider\u00a0taking\u00a0the following\u00a0steps:\n\n- **Understand user stories.**\u00a0User stories give you powerful information about the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. A user story is a quick description of everyday use cases and might include a few sentences about how the user expects the product to perform. A template might be something like this: \u201cAs a [role], I need [product] to do [goal of the software] so that I can [benefit of the product].\u201d\n- **Outline the most important requirements.**\u00a0Identify\u00a0what requirements are most essential based on the\u00a0high-level\u00a0business strategy. These requirements\u00a0may\u00a0be supported by user stories,\u00a0[functional\u00a0requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements)\u00a0and more based on the\u00a0[specific\u00a0client\u00a0goals](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/system-requirement-specifications/).\n- **Transform to product features.**\u00a0This\u00a0stage is about fine-tuning and translating the details that you\u2019ve gathered into product features. The development team collaborates to ensure that any requirements are easily understood by anyone working to implement them.\u00a0User stories are linked to features and tasks, so that\u00a0developers\u00a0understand what they need to do \u2013 but also\u00a0why they are doing it.\n\nAgile requirements management helps give you a foundation on which to\u00a0build, and best practices arm you with strategies that are proven\u00a0effective\u00a0at helping you move in\u00a0the direction of agile.\n\n### 2. Collaboration and Buy-In\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to get a company to agree on requirements, particularly for large projects with many stakeholders. In practice, it\u2019s not necessary to achieve consensus through compromise. It\u2019s more important to have team buy-in (before or after management approves the project) so the development process can move forward. With buy-in, the team backs the best solution, makes a smart decision and does what is necessary to move forward with the requirements management process.\n\nTeam collaboration is key to establishing good requirements. Collaborative teams work hard to make sure everyone has a stake in the project and provides feedback. When there is a commitment and understanding of project goals, team members tend to support other\u2019s decisions. It\u2019s when developers, testers or other stakeholders feel \u201cout of the loop\u201d that communication issues arise, people get frustrated and projects get delayed.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 How to Go Live](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-how-to-go-live)\n\n### 3. Traceability and Change Management\n\nRequirements traceability is a way to keep everyone in the loop. It organizes, documents and keeps track of all requirements, from initial idea to testing. A simple metaphor for traceability is connecting the dots to identify the relationships between items within a project. The following figure shows an example of a common downstream flow.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2018/06/the-four-fundamentals-of-requirements-management.png)\n\nCompanies should be able to trace each requirement back to its original business objective throughout the development process, not merely after it\u2019s complete. By tracing requirements, companies can identify the ripple effect changes have, see if they have completed a requirement and if they tested it properly. With traceability, and by managing changes effectively, managers gain the visibility to anticipate issues and ensure continuous quality.\n\nTraceability also makes sure the product meets all the vital requirements that come from different stakeholders. By tracing requirements, all team members stay connected to each other and to all interdependencies. And by managing changes well, a company can avoid scope creep \u2014 unplanned changes that occur when requirements are not clearly captured, understood and communicated. The benefit of good requirements is a clear understanding of the product and the scope involved. This leads to a better development schedule and budget, which prevents delays and cost overruns.\n\n### 4. Quality Assurance\n\nGetting requirements right the first time means better quality, faster development cycles and higher customer satisfaction with the product. Concise, specific requirements can help companies detect and solve problems earlier rather than later, when they are much more expensive to fix.\n\nResearch has shown that project teams can eliminate 50 percent to 80 percent of project defects by effectively managing requirements. In addition, according to Borland Software (now Micro Focus), it can cost up to 100 times more to correct a defect later in the development process, after it\u2019s been coded, than when it\u2019s still in written form.\n\nBy integrating requirements management best practices into their quality assurance process, companies can help teams increase efficiency and eliminate rework. According to the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, 60 to 80 percent of the cost of software development is in rework. In other words, development teams are wasting the majority of their budgets on efforts they didn\u2019t perform correctly the first time.\n\nRequirements management best practices can appear to be a complex topic, but at its core, it\u2019s a simple concept. It helps teams answer the question: Does everyone \u2014 from business leaders to product managers and project leaders to developers, QA managers and testers \u2014 understand what is being built and why?\n\nWhen everyone is\u00a0[collaborating and has full context and visibility into the discussions](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/), decisions and changes involved in product development, they maintain high quality and almost always ensure success.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss Reducing Risk in Product Development\n\nDEFINITION OF LIVE TRACEABILITY\u2122:\n\n**\tLive Traceability\u2122** is the ability for any engineer at any time to see the most up to date and complete up and downstream information for any requirement, no matter what stage of development it is in or how many siloed tools and teams it spans.\n\nPREVIOUSFour Stages of Requirements Management Processes\n\nNEXT UPStatus Request Changes\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

With buy-in, the team backs the best solution, makes a smart decision and does what is necessary to move forward with the requirements management process.\n\nTeam collaboration is key to establishing good requirements. Collaborative teams work hard to make sure everyone has a stake in the project and provides feedback. When there is a commitment and understanding of project goals, team members tend to support other\u2019s decisions. It\u2019s when developers, testers or other stakeholders feel \u201cout of the loop\u201d that communication issues arise, people get frustrated and projects get delayed.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 How to Go Live](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-how-to-go-live)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "3. Traceability and Change Management", "level": 3, "content": "Requirements traceability is a way to keep everyone in the loop. It organizes, documents and keeps track of all requirements, from initial idea to testing. A simple metaphor for traceability is connecting the dots to identify the relationships between items within a project. The following figure shows an example of a common downstream flow.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2018/06/the-four-fundamentals-of-requirements-management.png)\n\nCompanies should be able to trace each requirement back to its original business objective throughout the development process, not merely after it\u2019s complete. By tracing requirements, companies can identify the ripple effect changes have, see if they have completed a requirement and if they tested it properly. With traceability, and by managing changes effectively, managers gain the visibility to anticipate issues and ensure continuous quality.\n\nTraceability also makes sure the product meets all the vital requirements that come from different stakeholders. By tracing requirements, all team members stay connected to each other and to all interdependencies. And by managing changes well, a company can avoid scope creep \u2014 unplanned changes that occur when requirements are not clearly captured, understood and communicated. The benefit of good requirements is a clear understanding of the product and the scope involved. This leads to a better development schedule and budget, which prevents delays and cost overruns.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "4. Quality Assurance", "level": 3, "content": "Getting requirements right the first time means better quality, faster development cycles and higher customer satisfaction with the product. Concise, specific requirements can help companies detect and solve problems earlier rather than later, when they are much more expensive to fix.\n\nResearch has shown that project teams can eliminate 50 percent to 80 percent of project defects by effectively managing requirements. In addition, according to Borland Software (now Micro Focus), it can cost up to 100 times more to correct a defect later in the development process, after it\u2019s been coded, than when it\u2019s still in written form.\n\nBy integrating requirements management best practices into their quality assurance process, companies can help teams increase efficiency and eliminate rework. According to the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, 60 to 80 percent of the cost of software development is in rework. In other words, development teams are wasting the majority of their budgets on efforts they didn\u2019t perform correctly the first time.\n\nRequirements management best practices can appear to be a complex topic, but at its core, it\u2019s a simple concept. It helps teams answer the question: Does everyone \u2014 from business leaders to product managers and project leaders to developers, QA managers and testers \u2014 understand what is being built and why?\n\nWhen everyone is\u00a0[collaborating and has full context and visibility into the discussions](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/), decisions and changes involved in product development, they maintain high quality and almost always ensure success.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "In This Webinar, We Discuss Reducing Risk in Product Development", "level": 3, "content": "**\tLive Traceability\u2122** is the ability for any engineer at any time to see the most up to date and complete up and downstream information for any requirement, no matter what stage of development it is in or how many siloed tools and teams it spans.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Book a Demo", "level": 3, "content": "MktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;

Status tracking can help you avoid the pervasive \u201cninety percent done\u201d problem of software project tracking. Each requirement will have one of the following statuses at any time.\n\n- Proposed (someone suggested it)\n- Approved (it was allocated to a baseline)\n- Implemented (the code was designed, written, and unit tested)\n- Verified (the requirement passed its tests after integration into the product)\n- Deferred (the requirement will be implemented in a future release)\n- Deleted (you decided not to implement it at all)\n- Rejected (the idea was never approved)\n\nOther status options are possible, of course. Some organizations use a status of \u201cReviewed\u201d because they want to confirm that a requirement is of high quality before allocating it to a baseline. Other organizations use \u201cDelivered to Customer\u201d to indicate that a requirement has actually been released.\n\nWhen you ask a developer how he is coming along, he might say, \u201cOf the eighty-seven requirements allocated to this subsystem, sixty-one of them are verified, nine are implemented but not yet verified, and seventeen aren\u2019t yet completely implemented.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance that not all these requirements are the same size, will consume the same amount of implementation effort, or will deliver the same customer value. If I were a project manager, though, I\u2019d feel that we had a good handle on the size of that subsystem and how close we were to completion. This is far more informative than, \u201cI\u2019m about ninety percent done. Lookin\u2019 good!\u201d\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Identifying and Measuring the Quality of Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/identifying-and-measuring-the-quality-of-requirements)\n\n### Requests for Changes\n\nMuch of requirements management involves handling requirement additions, modifications, and deletions. Therefore, track the status and impact of your requirements change requests. The data you collect should let your team answer questions such as the following:\n\n- How many change requests were submitted in a given time period?\n- How many of these requests are open, and how many are closed?\n- How many requests were approved, and how many were rejected?\n- How much effort did the team spend implementing each approved change?\n- How long have the requests been open on average?\n- On average, how many individual requirements or other artifacts are affected by each submitted change request?\n\nMonitor how many changes are incorporated throughout development after you baselined the requirements for a specific release. Note that a single change request potentially can affect multiple requirements of different levels and types (user requirements, functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements). To calculate requirements volatility over a given time period, divide the number of changes by the total number of requirements at the beginning of the period (for example, at the time a baseline was defined):\n\nThe intent is not to try to eliminate requirements volatility. There are often good reasons to change requirements. However, we need to ensure that the project can manage the degree of requirements changes and still meet its commitments. Changes become more expensive as the product nears completion, and a sustained high level of approved change requests makes it difficult to know when you can ship the product. Most projects should become more resistant to making changes as development progresses, meaning the trend of accepted changes should approach zero as you near the planned completion date for a given release. An iterative development approach gives the team multiple opportunities to incorporate changes into subsequent iterations, while still keeping each iteration on schedule.\n\nIf you receive many change requests, that suggests that elicitation overlooked many requirements or that new ideas keep coming in as the project drags along month after month. Record where the change requests come from: marketing, users, sales, management, developers, and so on. The change request origins will tell you who to work with to reduce the number of overlooked, modified, and misunderstood requirements.\n\nChange requests that remain unresolved for a long time suggest that your change management process isn\u2019t working well. I once visited a company where a manager wryly admitted that they had enhancement requests that were several years old and still pending. This team should allocate certain of their open requests to specific planned maintenance releases and convert other long-term deferred change requests to a status of rejected. This would help the project manager focus the team\u2019s energy on the most important and most urgent items in the change backlog.\n\n### Effort\n\nFinally, I recommend that you record the time your team spends on requirements engineering activities. These activities include both requirements development (getting and writing good requirements) and requirements management (dealing with change, tracking status, recording traceability data, and so on).\n\nI\u2019m frequently asked how much time and effort a project should allocate to these functions. The answer depends enormously on the type and size of project, the developing team and organization, and the application domain. If you track your own team\u2019s investment in these critical project activities, you can better estimate how much effort to plan for future projects.\n\nSuppose that on one previous project, your team expended ten percent of its effort on requirements activities. In retrospect, you conclude that the requirements were too poorly defined and the project would have benefited from additional investment in developing quality requirements. The next time your team tackles a similar project, the project manager would be wise to allocate more than ten percent of the total project effort to the requirements work.\n\nAs you accumulate data, correlate the project development effort with some measure of product size. The documented requirements should give you an indication of size. You could correlate effort with the count of individually testable requirements, use case points, function points, or something else that is proportional to product size. As Figure 1 illustrates, such correlations provide a measure of your development team\u2019s productivity, which will help you estimate and scope individual release contents. If you collect some product size data and track the corresponding implementation effort, you\u2019ll be in a better position to create meaningful estimates for similar projects in the future.\n\nSome people are afraid that launching a software measurement effort will consume too much time, time they feel should be spent doing \u201creal work.\u201d My experience, though, is that a sensible and focused metrics program doesn\u2019t take much time or effort at all. It\u2019s mostly a matter of developing a simple infrastructure for collecting and analyzing the data, and getting team members in the habit of recording some key bits of data about their work. Once you\u2019ve developed a measurement culture in your organization, you\u2019ll be surprised how much you can learn from the data.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Product Size Requirements Quality](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/product-size-requirements-quality/)\n\n*Jama Software has partnered with Karl Wiegers to share licensed content from his books and articles on our web site via a series of blog posts, whitepapers and webinars.

For many projects, requirements documents can be hundreds of pages and change dozens of times during the development process. That means that teams sometimes spend hours circulating, editing, and tracking changes to a hefty requirements document with the hope that everyone reads it and stays engaged. Sometimes more time is spent reviewing and approving all the requirements than on the actual requirements engineering activities themselves. This can make a significant impact on project FTE and normally does not get budgeted appropriately.\n\nModern products are multifaceted and multidisciplinary, with hardware, software \u2013 plus Bioware, chemistry, and life sciences in the medical device industry \u2013, and various science and engineering approaches coming together in the name of superior customer experience. Many industries \u2014 medical device, automotive, and aerospace and defense, for instance \u2014 also require that complex product developers adhere to rigorous safety standards and regulations. Companies must work effectively and efficiently if they\u2019re going to grow their competitive advantage. And that all starts with requirements management.\n\nAnd the reality is, Word and Excel are not enough to manage complex requirements.\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t the requirements document itself. In fact, documents themselves are needed to record requirements. \u00a0The problem is in using the document to manage requirements. Current static tools, such as Word and Excel, don\u2019t support the accelerating development process, the speed of change, and navigating the complicated organizational documentation machinery It\u2019s no longer realistic to use documents to set expectations, communicate project details, and track changes throughout the process of developing today\u2019s complex products.\n\nAs the person responsible for ensuring everyone understands what we\u2019re building and why (a.k.a. requirements), you must evolve how you work. You must embrace new techniques and tools to find a better way to communicate requirements and deliver the right solutions while making the process as enjoyable as possible.\n\nBased on our own experience and that of our customers, we compiled the five biggest challenges of requirements management, as well as expert insight into how to conquer each one.\n\n### Challenge #1: The 11th Hour Swoop-In\n\n*An executive comes to you last minute with feedback that you needed three weeks ago.*\n\nWe\u2019ve been on both sides of this frustration, and it\u2019s not pleasant for either party. The reality is that managers are busy dealing with a variety of issues and are often forced to focus on what\u2019s most urgent. Also, ideas might be generated after leaders or stakeholders see prototypes and realize that what was specified in the initial requirements document is no longer the best solution.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Open**\n\nTo prevent the 11th hour swoop-in, you must be transparent and open to feedback at all phases of the project. Give management better visibility and a continuous feedback loop throughout the development process to address issues before it\u2019s too late. Frequent check-ins can help get reactions early. If your team and executive staff are in the same office, this is easier to accomplish. Have a whiteboard or dedicated wall sharing the latest designs in a prominent location, such as a project room or command center. Every day, folks walk by and have an opportunity to react to what they see. Most people respond better to visuals versus written words to understand the user experience.\n\nIf you\u2019re a distributed team in multiple locations, as is common today, then a specialized solution that provides everyone a central hub for the project\u2019s requirements, related designs, and Live Traceabili[ty\u2122](http://tytm/) will help. Anyone, no matter where they are, can see what\u2019s happening as the project evolves and you\u2019ll be able to see any disagreements or potential hang ups before they cause costly rework.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Write an Effective Product Requirements Document](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/how-to-write-an-effective-product-requirements-document)\n\n### Challenge #2: Decision Rehashing\n\n*Meetings are spent revisiting old decisions or bringing others up to speed.*\n\nDecisions may be overturned as new information becomes available during the development process. However, there are better\u2014and more cost-effective\u2014ways to work through these changes than hashing it out in team-wide meetings.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Clear**\n\nTo manage change well, the whole team needs the full context of the decisions made to understand why things are changing and how those changes impact the project\u2019s scope. People need clarity and understanding to execute at their best.\n\nThis applies upstream to your stakeholders and customers so they understand what they\u2019re getting. It also applies downstream to your design, development, and QA teams so they know exactly what to build and test properly.\n\nModern collaborative solutions exist that can help you capture the healthy debates and ongoing discussions that naturally take place around requirements, without the need for more meetings. People can see what others are saying and add their feedback anytime to agree or disagree, approve or reject, or propose edits to refine the solution.\n\nAlso, decisions made in meetings aren\u2019t easily tracked in documents and human memory fades over time. In some markets, such as the medical device industry, the documentation of a decision may also be a requirement. If missing decisions are an issue for your organization, adopt a new technique to capture decisions in line with requirements, and make them easy for the team to view anytime. This will eliminate ambiguity and ensure that decisions about the project are crystal clear.\n\n### Challenge #3: Change Tax\n\n*Manually sending updates to everyone when something changes.*\n\nWhen executing complex projects, change is going to happen, often for good reasons. As you get deeper into the design and development of a project, you know more than you did at the beginning. Thus, you and your team will think of better ways to build the desired product and modify the requirements along the way. If you try to manage versions and maintain visibility by tracking changes in Word documents, you\u2019ll experience a huge tax on your time.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Iterative**\n\nEmbrace changes intelligently by connecting the dots, quickly assessing the impact, and automatically communicating changes to the right people involved. You want your entire organization to feel empowered to propose a change if they find a better solution.\n\nThe number one reason to adopt Agile within your organization is to create a culture that is nimble so your team can respond quickly and effectively to changing requirements. In fact, the first principle in Agile development is, \u201cOur highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.\u201d\n\nThus, iterating in incremental development as you go.\n\nDon\u2019t get hung up on the labels or the debate of whether scrum or [kanban](https://businessmap.io/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban) is superior. There is no definitive, one-size-fits-all process. Agile first and foremost is a cultural mindset, not a prescriptive development process.\n\nEffective Agile teams maintain requirements best practices such as traceability, impact analysis, and change management, which are borrowed from traditional methods so they can understand the ripple effect a change has on the rest of the project.\n\nIt\u2019s a balancing act between agility and formal control. Some call it a hybrid approach. Again, the labels don\u2019t matter. The key is to find the mix of techniques that works best for your team so you can execute projects while encouraging/welcoming/responding to change.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What is Requirements Engineering? An Overview and Intro into Requirements Engineering](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-gathering-and-management-processes/requirements-engineering)\n\n### Challenge #4: Attention Deficit\n\n*Creating a detailed 200-page plan that no one has time to read, maintain, or review.*\n\nYou need to articulate your plan to those included in the product development process, and let stakeholders know explicitly what is relevant to them. The problem is, most people only care about specific parts of the plan at any given time. Some documents are required by regulations. However, if you\u2019re working in documents, you could spend a lot of time creating something few people will read. And, any time an item changes, folks must review the whole thing to find what\u2019s changed and determine each time if it\u2019s relevant to them or not. Eventually, people stop paying attention.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Relevant**\n\nAdopt the philosophy that everyone is simply too busy to absorb an entire requirements document. To avoid being frustrated by your organization\u2019s collective attention deficit, relevancy is key.\n\nThis is an area where product development solutions can help you break large, complex projects into smaller, manageable parts and let people focus on what\u2019s relevant to them. We recommend you manage the scope of projects item by item to get work done. If you\u2019re curious what we mean by \u201citem,\u201d a requirement is an item. A use case is an item. A test case is an item. A defect is an item.\n\nPeople naturally work on a list of a few items at a time. It\u2019s how our brains work, and we\u2019re more productive that way. By itemizing the scope of your projects using a solution with a relational database, it will allow people to focus on specific items they are working on and maintain the context of the overall project. Then, as needed for baselines, releases, or milestones, you can group together items and summarize the project via reports or a specification document for a holistic view.\n\n### Challenge #5: Mismatched Expectations\n\n*Stakeholders think they are getting one thing and are delivered another.*\n\nThe expectation gap can cause real problems for company morale\u2014not to mention your bottom line. Your development team takes pride in what they created, so when it doesn\u2019t meet expectations, they can feel as though their hard work is wasted. On the other side, stakeholders can feel as though they haven\u2019t been heard or that the development team didn\u2019t understand the request.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Proactive with Traceability**\n\nEvery project has changes during development, be they additional things to add or the reprioritization of features as the scope evolves. You must be able to document requests, justifications, decisions, agreements, and approvals made by the appropriate stakeholders. And that information must be available to everyone throughout the development process to ensure a consistent set of expectations.\n\nWhen developing a product or system against a requirement, teams must be aligned with the need, or problem, as stated and agreed upon with the stakeholders. For systems engineers, business analysts, and product owners, requirements traceability (the ability to trace requirements to downstream development, test, verification, validation, and risk activities) is an unquestioned good and an unquestioned need.\n\nWithout adding a lot of unnecessary overhead, modern requirements management solutions offer the capability to capture the decisions, reviews, approvals, and electronic signatures to scope changes, as well as provide context, all as part of the natural workflow.\n\nWith that level of visibility, everyone can be confident they know the plan, and your development team can feel good about delivering what\u2019s promised. And your launch event can be a celebration of your great work rather than an interrogation of what went wrong.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss the Benefits of Modern Requirements Management\n\nDEFINITION OF A REQUIREMENT:\n\n**A Requirement** is a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Checklist: Selecting a Requirements Management Tool](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-management-tools-and-software/checklist-selecting-a-requirements-management-tool)\n\nPREVIOUSStatus Request Changes\n\nNEXT UPWriting Requirements\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

The key is to find the mix of techniques that works best for your team so you can execute projects while encouraging/welcoming/responding to change.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What is Requirements Engineering? An Overview and Intro into Requirements Engineering](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-gathering-and-management-processes/requirements-engineering)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Challenge #4: Attention Deficit", "level": 3, "content": "*Creating a detailed 200-page plan that no one has time to read, maintain, or review.*\n\nYou need to articulate your plan to those included in the product development process, and let stakeholders know explicitly what is relevant to them. The problem is, most people only care about specific parts of the plan at any given time. Some documents are required by regulations. However, if you\u2019re working in documents, you could spend a lot of time creating something few people will read. And, any time an item changes, folks must review the whole thing to find what\u2019s changed and determine each time if it\u2019s relevant to them or not. Eventually, people stop paying attention.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Relevant**\n\nAdopt the philosophy that everyone is simply too busy to absorb an entire requirements document. To avoid being frustrated by your organization\u2019s collective attention deficit, relevancy is key.\n\nThis is an area where product development solutions can help you break large, complex projects into smaller, manageable parts and let people focus on what\u2019s relevant to them. We recommend you manage the scope of projects item by item to get work done. If you\u2019re curious what we mean by \u201citem,\u201d a requirement is an item. A use case is an item. A test case is an item. A defect is an item.\n\nPeople naturally work on a list of a few items at a time. It\u2019s how our brains work, and we\u2019re more productive that way. By itemizing the scope of your projects using a solution with a relational database, it will allow people to focus on specific items they are working on and maintain the context of the overall project. Then, as needed for baselines, releases, or milestones, you can group together items and summarize the project via reports or a specification document for a holistic view.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Challenge #5: Mismatched Expectations", "level": 3, "content": "*Stakeholders think they are getting one thing and are delivered another.*\n\nThe expectation gap can cause real problems for company morale\u2014not to mention your bottom line. Your development team takes pride in what they created, so when it doesn\u2019t meet expectations, they can feel as though their hard work is wasted. On the other side, stakeholders can feel as though they haven\u2019t been heard or that the development team didn\u2019t understand the request.\n\n**Expert Tip: Be Proactive with Traceability**\n\nEvery project has changes during development, be they additional things to add or the reprioritization of features as the scope evolves. You must be able to document requests, justifications, decisions, agreements, and approvals made by the appropriate stakeholders. And that information must be available to everyone throughout the development process to ensure a consistent set of expectations.\n\nWhen developing a product or system against a requirement, teams must be aligned with the need, or problem, as stated and agreed upon with the stakeholders. For systems engineers, business analysts, and product owners, requirements traceability (the ability to trace requirements to downstream development, test, verification, validation, and risk activities) is an unquestioned good and an unquestioned need.\n\nWithout adding a lot of unnecessary overhead, modern requirements management solutions offer the capability to capture the decisions, reviews, approvals, and electronic signatures to scope changes, as well as provide context, all as part of the natural workflow.\n\nWith that level of visibility, everyone can be confident they know the plan, and your development team can feel good about delivering what\u2019s promised.

Poor requirements are a primary source of project failure, leading to significant cost overruns, missed deadlines, and products that don\u2019t meet stakeholder expectations. For systems engineers managing large-scale projects with evolving needs and diverse technologies, the challenge of maintaining high-quality requirements is constant.\n\nThis guide will help you understand the common causes of poor requirements, their costly impact on the development lifecycle, and actionable strategies to prevent them. You will learn how to move from reactive problem-solving to proactive quality assurance, ensuring your projects are built on a solid foundation.\n\n**TL;DR:** This article explores how ambiguity, communication gaps, and inconsistent processes lead to bad requirements, which in turn cause costly rework and project delays. We\u2019ll cover best practices and AI-powered tools that help systems engineers write clear, accurate, and testable requirements from the start.\n\n### What Makes a Requirement\u201cPoor\u201d?\n\nA poor requirement is any specification that is unclear, incomplete, or untestable. While a \u201cgood\u201d requirement is clear, concise, and verifiable, a bad requirement often introduces risk and confusion. As a systems engineer, identifying these issues early is critical.\n\nHaving trouble deciphering between a good and bad requirement? Look out for some of these key characteristics of poor requirements.\n\n![Hallmarks of poor requirements: ambiguity, incompleteness, inconsistency, untestability, and infeasibility.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/09/Hallmarks-of-Poor-Requirements-1-1030x837.png)\n\n### The Top 5 Causes of Poor Requirements\n\nUnderstanding the root causes of bad requirements is the first step toward preventing them. Most issues can be traced back to a handful of common process and communication breakdowns.\n\n**1. Ambiguity and Lack of Clarity**\n\nVague language is the most frequent culprit. When requirements are not written with precision, teams are forced to guess the intended meaning, which almost always leads to errors. This includes undefined acronyms, subjective terminology, and poorly constructed sentences.\n\n**2. Incomplete or Missing Information**\n\nThis happens when stakeholders fail to provide all necessary details. Unstated assumptions are particularly dangerous, as different team members may fill in the gaps with conflicting ideas. A requirement might specify what the system should do but omit crucial details about how it should perform under specific conditions.\n\n**3. Poor Stakeholder Communication**\n\nComplex projects involve numerous stakeholders, each with their own perspective and priorities. Without a structured process for gathering and reconciling input, the resulting requirements can be a collection of conflicting demands. This lack of a unified vision creates confusion and rework down the line.\n\n**4. Unmanaged Scope Creep**\n\nProjects naturally evolve, but when changes to requirements are not properly documented, tracked, and approved, chaos ensues. This uncontrolled expansion of project scope, known as scope creep, leads to outdated or contradictory requirements that no longer reflect the project\u2019s goals.\n\n**5. Lack of a Standardized Process**\n\nWithout a consistent format, review cycle, and authoring guidelines, requirements quality will vary wildly across teams and projects. This lack of standardization makes it difficult to manage, trace, and reuse requirements effectively, compounding inefficiencies.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u2019s Requirements Management Enables Live Traceability\u2122 Across Your Development Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\n\n### The Ripple Effect: How Bad Requirements Derail Projects\n\nThe consequences of poor requirements extend far beyond the initial design phase. They create a domino effect that impacts the entire development lifecycle \u2013 and your company\u2019s bottom line.\n\n- **Costly Rework:** Defects caused by poor requirements can consume up to 85% of project rework costs. Fixing an error in the requirements phase is exponentially cheaper than fixing it after the product has been built and tested.\n- **Project Delays:** Ambiguous or incomplete requirements force development teams to stop and seek clarification, leading to significant delays. Rework cycles further push back timelines, jeopardizing market delivery.\n- **Product Failure and Safety Risks:** In safety-critical industries like aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, a poorly defined requirement can lead to catastrophic system failure, posing serious risks to end-users.\n- **Decreased Team Morale:** Nothing is more frustrating for an engineering team than spending weeks building a feature, only to find out it was based on a misunderstanding of the requirements. This cycle of rework can damage morale and reduce productivity.\n\n### A Modern Solution: Improving Requirements Quality with AI\n\nFor systems engineers, manually reviewing every requirement for clarity, consistency, and completeness is a monumental task, especially in large-scale projects. This is where modern tools can make a significant difference.\n\n###### The key takeaway is that leveraging technology can transform requirements management from a manual, error-prone process into an efficient, data-driven one.\n\n**Jama Connect Advisor\u2122** brings the power of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing directly into the requirements authoring process. It acts as an intelligent assistant for systems engineers, helping to identify and fix poor requirements in real time. By analyzing requirements against proven industry standards like the [INCOSE Rules](https://www.incose.org/about-incose) and [EARS Notation](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/), it provides immediate, actionable feedback.\n\nWith Jama Connect Advisor, you can:\n\n- **Eliminate ambiguity** by flagging vague terms and suggesting precise alternatives.\n- **Ensure completeness** by identifying missing information.\n- **Standardize authoring** across all teams with consistent, rule-based guidance.\n- **Monitor quality over time** with detailed scores and reports to drive continuous improvement.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae Features in Five: Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/jama-connect-features-in-five-jama-connect-advisor/)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Most issues can be traced back to a handful of common process and communication breakdowns.\n\n**1. Ambiguity and Lack of Clarity**\n\nVague language is the most frequent culprit. When requirements are not written with precision, teams are forced to guess the intended meaning, which almost always leads to errors. This includes undefined acronyms, subjective terminology, and poorly constructed sentences.\n\n**2. Incomplete or Missing Information**\n\nThis happens when stakeholders fail to provide all necessary details. Unstated assumptions are particularly dangerous, as different team members may fill in the gaps with conflicting ideas. A requirement might specify what the system should do but omit crucial details about how it should perform under specific conditions.\n\n**3. Poor Stakeholder Communication**\n\nComplex projects involve numerous stakeholders, each with their own perspective and priorities. Without a structured process for gathering and reconciling input, the resulting requirements can be a collection of conflicting demands. This lack of a unified vision creates confusion and rework down the line.\n\n**4. Unmanaged Scope Creep**\n\nProjects naturally evolve, but when changes to requirements are not properly documented, tracked, and approved, chaos ensues.

We buy it for what it will\u00a0*do*\u00a0for us.\n\nLikewise, when companies or governments buy new systems or new enterprise software products, they couldn\u2019t care less about the products themselves. What they care about is how those products will help them accomplish their goals, make them more efficient, and positively impact their bottom line or use of budget.\n\nIt\u2019s what the product does that\u2019s important.\n\nIn general, the first step in determining what a product does\u2014what its functions are\u2014is to determine its\u00a0**functional requirements**.\n\nWhat are functional requirements? And what is their role in product development?\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll answer those questions, provide examples of typical functional requirements and types of requirements, and offer tips for crafting good functional requirements and good functional requirement specifications.\n\n### What are functional requirements in product development?\n\nA functional requirement is a statement of what a product (system, subsystem, system component, device or software program) must do.\n\nTypes of functional requirements include prescriptions of (rules for):\n\n- Operations and workflows the product must perform (i.e., the functional details of the product\u2019s features)\n- Formats and validity of data to be input and output by the product\n- User interface behavior\n- Data integrity and data security requirements\n- What the product must do to meet safety and other regulatory requirements\n- How the system validates user access/authorization for use and modification of the system\n\n### The difference between functional requirements and nonfunctional requirements\n\nThe term\u00a0*functional requirements*\u00a0implies there must also be a group classified as\u00a0*non-functional requirements*. That is indeed the case. Here are definitions of both:\n\nA\u00a0**functional requirement**\u00a0is a statement of what a product (system, subsystem, device, or software program) must do.\n\nExample: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*The control system shall prevent engine overspeed*.\n\nA\u00a0**non-functional requirement**\u00a0is a statement of what a product is or how it will be constructed, or a constraint on how the product will be designed or will behave.\n\nExample: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Serial-digital communication between the system\u2019s subsystems shall be accomplished via MIL-STD-1553B bus(es).*\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What Are Non-Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-non-functional-requirements-impact-product-development)\n\n#### Functional Requirements\n\nAs mentioned, functional requirements state what the product must do. In other words, they define the operation of the product. As such, they should normally be stated in terms of what the product\u2019s outputs do in response to its inputs.\n\nIn product development, functional requirements are typically decomposed into more detailed requirements at progressive levels of the design process. Their fulfillment is verified and validated through functional testing (software testing, integration testing, etc.). Functional requirements are always mandatory; they must be met by the product unless the requirement is changed.\n\n#### Nonfunctional Requirements\n\nNon-functional requirements state constraints on the design and construction of the product. They are often dictated by contractual or regulatory requirements, which may include, among others:\n\n- Standardization requirements\n- Compatibility requirements\n- In-service support requirements\n- End-of-life disposal requirements.\n\nNon-functional requirements are not often decomposed into more detailed requirements. They are typically verified by inspection of the product and its documentation. Non-functional requirements will be mandatory if dictated by contractual or regulatory requirements. They may not be mandatory, however, if dictated by marketing goals or other internal objectives, as often occurs in consumer product development.\n\n### Forms and examples of functional requirements\n\nFunctional requirements can come in many forms. Some forms, however, are better than others. A general requirements engineering (RE) best practice is to write requirements that are as clear and concise as possible.\n\nEngineer Alistair Mavin, developer of the\u00a0[Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)](https://qracorp.com/easy-approach-to-requirements-syntax-ears-guide/), has identified five requirements archetypes\u2014and a simple template for each\u2014that can be used to craft clear, concise requirement statements that cover practically all functional specification needs.\n\n### Real-World Examples of Functional Requirements Across Industries\n\nFunctional requirements are vital for defining what a product must do to meet user and organizational needs. To truly bring this concept to life, here are real-world examples of functional requirements across various industries, including software development, automotive, healthcare, and e-commerce.\n\n**1. Software Development**\n\nFunctional requirements in software development often define how a system operates, controls, or interacts with users.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement: *The system shall display search results within 0.5 seconds of the user entering a query.\n\n*Context:* For a search engine or content management platform, fast response time is critical to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When a user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials three times, the system shall lock the user account for 10 minutes.\n\nContext: This is designed to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access through brute-force attacks.\n\n**2. Automotive Industry**\n\nThe automotive sector often focuses on safety, performance, and user interaction. Functional requirements here ensure vehicles meet regulatory and customer expectations.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The vehicle\u2019s lane assist system shall alert the driver with an audible beep when the car drifts from its lane without signaling.\n\nContext: This feature enhances safety by providing drivers with real-time feedback to avoid accidents.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When the airbags deploy, the vehicle shall automatically notify emergency services with the GPS location within 30 seconds.\n\n*Context:* This functionality supports rapid response during accidents, potentially saving lives.\n\n**3. Healthcare**\n\nHealthcare applications, whether software-based or medical devices, have stringent functional requirements to ensure patient safety and compliance with regulatory standards.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The electronic health record (EHR) system shall retrieve a patient\u2019s medical history within 3 seconds upon request.\n\n*Context:* This is essential for healthcare professionals to access critical information quickly, especially in emergencies.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* The insulin pump shall deliver the prescribed insulin dosage within a tolerance of \u00b11% to the specified volume at the programmed time intervals.\n\n*Context:* Precision is critical to ensure patient safety and maintain blood sugar levels effectively.\n\n**4. E-Commerce**\n\nFunctional requirements in e-commerce focus on usability, security, and efficient transactions to enhance customer satisfaction and trust.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The e-commerce platform shall process credit card payments and provide a transaction confirmation within 5 seconds of user submission.\n\n*Context:* This ensures a seamless checkout experience and reinforces customer trust.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When a product is out of stock, the system shall display an out-of-stock notification and disable the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d button.\n\n*Context:* This helps manage customer expectations and prevents frustration caused by unfulfilled orders.\n\n### \n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Functional Requirements\n\nCrafting functional requirements is a crucial step in the product development process. However, even experienced teams can fall into common pitfalls, leading to miscommunication, delays, and costly errors. To help you avoid these issues, here are some typical mistakes and their potential impacts, along with practical examples.\n\n**1. Writing Vague or Ambiguous Requirements**\n\nOne of the most common mistakes is failing to write clear and specific requirements. Ambiguity can lead to confusion among developers, testers, and stakeholders, resulting in inconsistent implementations.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system should process requests quickly.\n\n*Impact:* Without a measurable standard, \u201cquickly\u201d could mean seconds to one person and minutes to another, leading to unmet expectations.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nBe precise. Rephrase the requirement to something like:\n\n- The system shall process requests and deliver a response within 0.3 seconds.\n\n**2. Combining Multiple Requirements into One**\n\nOverloading a single requirement statement can make it hard to implement, understand, or test properly.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall validate user credentials, display a welcome message, and send a verification email.\n\n*Impact:* This statement covers several actions that should be distinct, making traceability and testing difficult.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nBreak it into multiple requirements:\n\n- The system shall validate user login credentials.\n- If login is successful, the system shall display a welcome message.\n- The system shall send a verification email upon successful registration.\n\n**3. Mixing Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**\n\nAnother frequent error is combining functional requirements (what the system does) with non-functional requirements (how the system performs).\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall process up to 1,000 transactions per second and ensure user data security.\n\n*Impact:* Performance requirements (non-functional) and security measures (functional) are conflated, complicating design and verification.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nSeparate these into distinct requirements\n\n- Functional requirement:\n\nThe system shall ensure user data is encrypted during transmission.\n- Non-functional requirement:\n\nThe system must process up to 1,000 transactions per second.\n\n[(See Functional vs. nonfunctional requirements: What\u2019s the difference?)](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements/)\n\n**4. Ignoring Testability**\n\nRequirements that cannot be verified lead to inefficiencies in the development and testing process.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall provide an exceptional user experience.\n\n*Impact:* \u201cExceptional user experience\u201d is subjective and not directly testable.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nDefine measurable criteria:\n\n- The system shall achieve a score of 90 or higher on standardized usability testing.\n\n**5. Overloading with Technical Jargon**\n\nUsing overly technical or niche language can alienate non-technical stakeholders and create barriers to collaboration.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The application\u2019s backend must support asynchronous message queuing through a JMS-compliant interface.\n\n*Impact:* This phrasing might confuse stakeholders unfamiliar with these terms, delaying approvals.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nUse clear and straightforward language without losing technical accuracy:\n\n- The system shall enable message queuing with support for asynchronous processing.\n\n**6. Failing to Include Rationale**\n\nWhen the purpose of a requirement isn\u2019t clear, it leaves room for misinterpretation or challenges during implementation.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall log every user action.\n\n*Impact:* Developers might implement extensive logging that impacts performance because the reason for detailed logs isn\u2019t explained.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nInclude rationale:\n\n- The system shall log every user action for security auditing and compliance purposes.\n\n**7. Not Regularly Reviewing Requirements**\n\nRequirements that are not [reviewed and updated](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-overcome-developmental-challenges-optimizing-review-cycles-for-regulated-industries/) throughout the project lifecycle risk becoming outdated or incomplete.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\nFailing to account for regulatory changes that require adjustments to existing requirements.\n\n*Impact:* This can lead to costly rework if requirements need updates late in the development process.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nSchedule regular reviews with key stakeholders to ensure requirements remain relevant and consistent with the project\u2019s goals.\n\n**8. Over-Engineering the Requirements**\n\nIncluding excessive detail or edge cases in requirements can burden the development process and extend timelines unnecessarily.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall display 20 different font styles for every text field customization.\n\n*Impact:* Overly complex requirements can divert resources from critical functionality and strain timelines.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nFocus on core needs and gather user feedback to determine reasonable scopes.\n\n#### \n\n#### Ubiquitous Requirements\n\nThe first of these archetypes is the ubiquitous requirement.\n\nUbiquitous functional requirements are always active. They are not invoked by an event or input, nor are they limited to a subset of the system\u2019s operating states.\n\n*Template: The shall.*\n\n*Example: The control system shall prevent engine overspeed.*\n\n#### State-driven Requirements\n\nState-driven functional requirements are active throughout the time a defined state remains true. In Mavin\u2019s [EARS method](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/how-the-ears-notation-supports-effective-requirements-management-and-live-traceability/), state-driven requirements are identified with the keyword WHILE.\n\n*Template: WHILE the shall .*\n\n*Example: While the aircraft is in-flight and the engine is running, the control system shall maintain engine fuel flow above ?? lbs/sec.*\n\n#### Event-driven Requirements\n\nEvent-driven functional requirements require a response only when an event is detected at the system boundary. In other words, they are triggered by a specific event. The EARS method identifies event-driven requirements with the keyword WHEN.\n\n*Template: WHEN the shall .*\n\n*Example: When continuous ignition is commanded by the aircraft, the control system shall switch on continuous ignition.*\n\n#### Optional Feature Requirements\n\nOptional feature functional requirements apply only when an optional feature is present as a part of the system. These requirements are identified by the EARS method with the keyword WHERE.\n\n*Template: WHERE the shall.*\n\n*Example: Where the control system includes an overspeed protection function, the control system shall test the availability of the overspeed protection function before aircraft dispatch.*\n\n#### Unwanted Behavior Requirements\n\nUnwanted behavior functional requirements cover all undesirable situations. Good systems engineering (SE) practice anticipates undesirable situations and imposes requirements to mitigate them.\n\nUnwanted behavior requirements are often imposed when the system must respond to a trigger under less than optimum conditions. The EARS method uses the keyword combination IF/THEN to identify requirements aimed at mitigating unwanted behavior.\n\n*Template:\u00a0IF, THEN the shall.*\n\n*Example: If the computed airspeed is unavailable, then the control system shall use modeled airspeed.*\n\n#### Complex Requirements\n\nOften, a specific set of one or more preconditions (states or optional features) must be present before the occurrence a specific event for that event to trigger a required system response. In such cases, the EARS templates may be combined, using a combination of the keywords.\n\nComplex requirements can be composed for desired behavior or for unwanted behavior. The EARS method provides a template for each.\n\n*Template:\u00a0(Desired behavior) Where, while , when the shall .*\n\n*Template:\u00a0(Unwanted behavior) Where, while , if then the shall .*\n\n*Example: While the aircraft is on the ground, when reverse thrust is commanded, the control system shall enable deployment of the thrust reverser.*\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

That\u2019s why many engineering organizations compile guidance on writing requirements, like the\u00a0[Guide for Writing Requirements](https://reqexperts.com/2017/07/15/incose-guide-for-writing-requirements-2017-update/)\u00a0published by the International Council on Systems Engineering (INCOSE).\n\nAn exhaustive list of such guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, but here are six important tips to bear in mind when composing functional requirements:\n\n#### 1. Be consistent in the use of modal verbs\n\nA modal verb, modal or modal auxiliary is a word such as \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d which is used with a\u00a0main\u00a0verb to express\u00a0ideas\u00a0such as necessity, intention, expectation, recommendation, or possibility.\n\nIn engineering specifications, modal verbs are used to distinguish between binding requirements, non-binding recommendations, and the expected behavior of the system\u2019s operational environment. As such, it is important that requirements authors be consistent in their use of modal verbs and that they convey to developers, testers, quality assurance engineers, and regulatory authorities exactly how each modal verb is intended to be interpreted within their specification.\n\nThe use of modal verbs in specifications has long been a subject of debate in the SE/RE community. The consensus, however, is that \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d are the best modal verb choices for expressing requirements, while \u201cwill\u201d should be used to express expected external behavior or declarations of purpose. Non-binding recommendations or provisions can be expressed with \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cmay.\u201d\n\nAlso, many organizations use the word \u201cmust\u201d to express constraints and certain quality and performance requirements (non-functional require\u00adments). The use of \u201cmust\u201d allows them to express constraints without resorting to passive voice and to easily distinguish between functional requirements (expressed with \u201cshall\u201d) and non-func\u00adtional requirements (expressed with \u201cmust\u201d).\n\nIt is good SE/RE practice to define exactly how certain terms will be used within the document itself, and how they should be interpreted when found in non-requirements documents refer\u00adenced by the document. This is usually done in a dedicated section toward the beginning of the specification.\n\n#### 2. Tag each requirement with a unique identifier\n\nAnother SE/RE best practice is to tag each requirement with a unique ID number or code.\n\nIn fact, requirement identifiers are often a requirement them\u00adselves. Systems purchased under a contract between a customer and a supplier\u2014as in the case of most government-purchased systems, for example\u2014are normally developed following an accepted industry standard like IEEE/EIA 12207 as a stipula\u00adtion of the contract. Such standards typically require that each requirement in every requirements document be tagged with a\u00a0*project unique identifier*\u00a0(PUI).\n\nAssigning unique identifiers to requirements conveys a big benefit to the system developer.\n\nTagging each requirement with a PUI facilitates and simplifies traceability between requirements at successive design levels and the tests that verify them. Brief identifiers make it easy to build traceability tables that clearly link each requirement to its ancestors in higher-level documents, and to the specific tests intended to verify it. Traceability tables simplify the process of demonstrating to the customer and internal stakeholders that the system has been developed to, and proven to comply with, the agreed top-level requirements.\n\nAutomated[\u00a0requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0typically include an automatic method of assigning unique identifiers, which streamlines this process.\n\n#### 3. Write only one requirement in each requirement statement\n\nBeware of long, complex requirement statements that include the word \u201cand\u201d and more than one modal verb.\n\nWhen trying to define a complicated functionality, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of describing it all in a single paragraph or, worse yet, in a single sentence. Take the time to analyze long requirement statements. If they contain the word and or multiple \u201cshalls\u201d or other modals, they likely contain more than one requirement. Re-write them to obtain two or more simple requirement statements, each with its own shall. Then, give each its own unique identifier.\n\n#### 4. Write requirements statements as concisely as possible\n\nAnother reason to analyze and re-write long requirements, even those with a single shall, is that long requirements are more likely to be misinterpreted than short, concise requirements.\n\nIt is good SE/RE practice to write requirements that are as concise as possible. Requirements templates, like the EARS patterns described earlier, can be of great assistance in meeting this objective.\n\n#### 5. Make sure each requirement is testable.\n\nEach time you write a new functional requirement, you should ask yourself the following question:\n\n*How will the successful implementation of this requirement be verified?*\n\nWriting requirements with a specific test scenario in mind helps ensure both design and test engineers will understand what they have to do.\n\nThe specific test case will influence how detailed the requirement will need to be. High-level requirements are often tested by inspection or through user testing and thus may be broad in scope. Lower-level requirements that will be verified through software testing or system integration testing will necessarily be specified to a finer degree of detail.\n\nFor example, a best practice for ensuring testability is to specify a maximum reaction time for any output the software must produce in response to a specific input condition, as in this example:\n\n*3.8.5.3.1: The Engine Monitor shall set  to TRUE within 0.5 seconds when  equals or exceeds 215\u00b0 F.*\n\n#### 6. Clearly segregate requirement statements from rationale and other explanations.\n\nIn requirement specifications, it\u2019s useful to include the rationale for the requirement, its relationship to other requirements, and other explanation to provide context for developers and testers.\n\nContext can help prevent misinterpretation by clearing away possible ambiguities. It can help others fully understand the intent of the requirement and provide feedback that can help refine the requirement and make it even more unambiguous.\n\nBut contextual information should not be included in the requirement statement itself. It\u2019s important to segregate the two to keep the requirement itself clear and concise, and to avoid making the additional information subject to implementation and test. It\u2019s a best practice to put contextual implementation in a separate paragraph that does not contain a unique identifier.\n\nA good Functional Requirements Document template or Requirements Management tool can make this goal easier to achieve.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Functional vs Nonfunctional Requirements: What\u2019s the difference?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-functional-requirement-vs-non-functional-requirements/)\n\n### What is a Functional Requirements Document?\n\nA functional requirements document (FRD)\u2014also known as a functional requirements specification, functional specification, or functional specification document\u2014is a more technically detailed follow-on to the higher-level Product Requirements Document (PRD).\n\nThe FRD describes what is needed by the system user, typically in terms of the system\u2019s outputs as functions of its inputs. It is built to provide precise functional requirements\u2014along with guidance to developers and testers\u2014following analysis and decomposition of the requirements in the PRD.\n\nAn FRD does not define the inner workings of the system to be developed or how the system\u2019s functions will be implemented. Instead, it focuses on what various external agents (users, peripherals, other systems or subsystems) should observe when interacting with the system. It communicates:\n\n- To developers: what they need to build\n- To testers: what tests they need to perform\n- To stakeholders: a detailed description of what they\u2019re going to get\n\nFor highly complex systems, functional requirements may be decomposed through a series of functional specifications that may include:\n\n- System specification\n- Subsystem specifications\n- System component specifications\n- Software requirements specifications\n\nIn some industries and organizations, the functional specification will normally be part of a larger specification that also contains the non-functional requirements applicable to the system or subsystem to be designed. Nevertheless, those non-functional requirements will typically be segregated from the functional requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)\n\n### Tips for compiling a good FRD\n\nPutting together a cohesive, usable and easily navigable and FRD can be a challenge. Here are a few guidelines that can be helpful.\n\n#### 1. Organize the document in a hierarchical structure\n\nTo make your FRD easy to understand and use, organize it using a hierarchical structure. Suitable hierarchies can include (among others):\n\n- Mission/phase/function\n- Function/subfunction\n- Feature/use case\n\nA hierarchical specification structure provides several benefits, including:\n\n- Helps contributors focus on each specific domain that needs to be addressed\n- Helps contributors easily find areas they need to modify when adding functionality to an existing system\n- Helps users (developers, testers) quickly drill down to the exact functional area they are looking for\n\n#### 2. Standardize your requirements language\n\nSpoken languages are full of words that have multiple definitions and which evoke subtle shades of meaning, depending on context. While great for self-expression, such broad flexibility can lead to confusion and disagreement when it comes to specifying and interpreting requirements.\n\nA good way to reduce ill-definition and misinterpretation of requirements is to standardize some of the language used to express them. Create a glossary of standardized terms toward the beginning of your requirements document. In this glossary, define exactly how certain terms will be used within the document itself, and how they should be interpreted when found in non-requirements documents referenced by the document.\n\nStrictly defining terms and adhering strictly to your definitions will not only reduce confusion among those tasked with interpreting your requirements; with practice, using standardized language will also save you time in writing requirements.\n\n#### 3. Use a good FRD template or a dedicated RM platform\n\nWhen building any type of structure, it\u2019s wise to start from a solid foundation or a proven model. When building a functional requirements document, it\u2019s best to start from a good template.\n\nA good template will include standardized sections such as:\n\n- Guidelines for the use of modal verbs\n- Glossary of standardized terms\n- Guidelines for documenting requirements\n- Guidelines for managing requirements documentation\n- Other guidelines your organization follows\n\nStandardized sections\u2014or \u201cboilerplate\u201d\u2014promote and facilitate consistency across projects, which is a major benefit of templates. These sections tend to remain little changed from project to project, and from team to team within a company. They evolve only slowly over time with changes in methodology and lessons learned. Thus, they provide a stable platform for consistent requirements development, employee education, and communication with customers.\n\nThere are many general FRD templates available on the web. If you develop commercial products you may find one of the following can be tailored to your company\u2019s practices and procedures:\n\n- [https://almooc.com/downloads/FRDTemplate.doc](https://almooc.com/downloads/FRDTemplate.doc)\n- [https://doit.maryland.gov/SDLC/Documents/func_req_doc.doc](https://doit.maryland.gov/SDLC/Documents/func_req_doc.doc)\n- [https://www.sampletemplates.com/business-templates/functional-requirement-document.html](https://www.sampletemplates.com/business-templates/functional-requirement-document.html)\n\nIf your company develops systems or software for the U.S. Department of Defense, on the other hand, you might prefer a system specification template built to MIL-STD-961E (Department of Defense Standard Practice: Defense and Program-Unique Specifications Format and Content). QRA Corp offers one on their website:\u00a0[https://qracorp.com/requirements-document-templates/](https://qracorp.com/requirements-document-templates/).\n\n#### The drawbacks of templates\n\nOne caveat to the last tip: using a template in a general documentation platform has a couple of drawbacks. First, documenting requirements in Word, Excel or Google Docs tends to make collaboration cumbersome. Second, those platforms are not built to support clear and systematic requirements traceability.\n\nGartner says that one of the main reasons companies struggle to achieve adequate visibility and traceability in their requirement specifications is reliance on general document software rather than a collaborative requirements management platform.\n\n*\u201cThe most widely adopted tools for requirements continue to be general document software such as Microsoft Office or Google Docs (40% to 50% of the market) due to cost, availability, and familiarity. Yet these often lead to poorly managed requirements, thus eliminating and exceeding any cost benefit the tools themselves have. Requirements end up captured in a variety of documents and spreadsheets supplemented by post-it notes in unmanaged versions with no traceability or reuse. This creates a more costly user acceptance testing cycle, both in the time to execute as well as remediation of issues found late in the process, where they are far more costly to address.\u201d*\u00a0\u2013 Gartner Research\n\nSuccessful development, verification, and validation of good functional requirements are critical to product success. To achieve these goals system, software, hardware, test, and integration teams all must work closely together to assure the project\u2019s functional requirements, non-functional requirements, test cases, and verification/validation procedures are all adequately defined. Visibility and traceability are critical to this process.\n\nA good requirements management (RM) platform will provide fields, formatting, and structural relationships to facilitate:\n\n- Portability of boilerplate sections from project to project\n- Requirements definition and identification\n- Traceability to higher-level (parent) and lower-level (child) requirements\n- Traceability to test cases\n\nBeyond those basic facilities, a state-of-the-art RM platform will also facilitate team collaboration by allowing all users access to your latest requirements baseline and all pending changes to it. This makes requirements tracking, traceability, and test coverage assurance far easier to accomplish than can be done using a document or spreadsheet.\n\nLearn more about how Jama Connect streamlines tracking and tracing requirements.\u00a0[See the solution.](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect?utm_campaign=cta+blog&_gl=1*qj12fb*_ga*MTE3MDAzODMyOC4xNjI4NTk1Njg1*_ga_JQG3M83PDQ*MTYyODg2NjY3MS4zLjAuMTYyODg2NjY3MS4w)\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn the Difference Between Functional&Non-Functional Requirements\n\nDEFINITION OF NONFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS\n\n**Nonfunctional requirements** are a type of requirement that may not relate to functionality, but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability and portability.\n\nPREVIOUSThree Reasons You Need a Requirements Management Solution\n\nNEXT UPAdopting the EARS Notation to Improve Requirements Engineering\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

To truly bring this concept to life, here are real-world examples of functional requirements across various industries, including software development, automotive, healthcare, and e-commerce.\n\n**1. Software Development**\n\nFunctional requirements in software development often define how a system operates, controls, or interacts with users.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement: *The system shall display search results within 0.5 seconds of the user entering a query.\n\n*Context:* For a search engine or content management platform, fast response time is critical to ensure a smooth user experience.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When a user attempts to log in with incorrect credentials three times, the system shall lock the user account for 10 minutes.\n\nContext: This is designed to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access through brute-force attacks.\n\n**2. Automotive Industry**\n\nThe automotive sector often focuses on safety, performance, and user interaction. Functional requirements here ensure vehicles meet regulatory and customer expectations.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The vehicle\u2019s lane assist system shall alert the driver with an audible beep when the car drifts from its lane without signaling.\n\nContext: This feature enhances safety by providing drivers with real-time feedback to avoid accidents.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When the airbags deploy, the vehicle shall automatically notify emergency services with the GPS location within 30 seconds.\n\n*Context:* This functionality supports rapid response during accidents, potentially saving lives.\n\n**3. Healthcare**\n\nHealthcare applications, whether software-based or medical devices, have stringent functional requirements to ensure patient safety and compliance with regulatory standards.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The electronic health record (EHR) system shall retrieve a patient\u2019s medical history within 3 seconds upon request.\n\n*Context:* This is essential for healthcare professionals to access critical information quickly, especially in emergencies.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* The insulin pump shall deliver the prescribed insulin dosage within a tolerance of \u00b11% to the specified volume at the programmed time intervals.\n\n*Context:* Precision is critical to ensure patient safety and maintain blood sugar levels effectively.\n\n**4. E-Commerce**\n\nFunctional requirements in e-commerce focus on usability, security, and efficient transactions to enhance customer satisfaction and trust.\n\n*Example 1:*\n\n*Requirement:* The e-commerce platform shall process credit card payments and provide a transaction confirmation within 5 seconds of user submission.\n\n*Context:* This ensures a seamless checkout experience and reinforces customer trust.\n\n*Example 2:*\n\n*Requirement:* When a product is out of stock, the system shall display an out-of-stock notification and disable the \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d button.\n\n*Context:* This helps manage customer expectations and prevents frustration caused by unfulfilled orders.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Common Mistakes to Avoid When Writing Functional Requirements", "level": 3, "content": "Crafting functional requirements is a crucial step in the product development process. However, even experienced teams can fall into common pitfalls, leading to miscommunication, delays, and costly errors. To help you avoid these issues, here are some typical mistakes and their potential impacts, along with practical examples.\n\n**1. Writing Vague or Ambiguous Requirements**\n\nOne of the most common mistakes is failing to write clear and specific requirements. Ambiguity can lead to confusion among developers, testers, and stakeholders, resulting in inconsistent implementations.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system should process requests quickly.\n\n*Impact:* Without a measurable standard, \u201cquickly\u201d could mean seconds to one person and minutes to another, leading to unmet expectations.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nBe precise. Rephrase the requirement to something like:\n\n**2. Combining Multiple Requirements into One**\n\nOverloading a single requirement statement can make it hard to implement, understand, or test properly.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall validate user credentials, display a welcome message, and send a verification email.\n\n*Impact:* This statement covers several actions that should be distinct, making traceability and testing difficult.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nBreak it into multiple requirements:\n\n**3. Mixing Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**\n\nAnother frequent error is combining functional requirements (what the system does) with non-functional requirements (how the system performs).\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall process up to 1,000 transactions per second and ensure user data security.\n\n*Impact:* Performance requirements (non-functional) and security measures (functional) are conflated, complicating design and verification.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nSeparate these into distinct requirements\n\n[(See Functional vs. nonfunctional requirements: What\u2019s the difference?)](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/functional-vs-non-functional-requirements/)\n\n**4. Ignoring Testability**\n\nRequirements that cannot be verified lead to inefficiencies in the development and testing process.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall provide an exceptional user experience.\n\n*Impact:* \u201cExceptional user experience\u201d is subjective and not directly testable.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nDefine measurable criteria:\n\n**5. Overloading with Technical Jargon**\n\nUsing overly technical or niche language can alienate non-technical stakeholders and create barriers to collaboration.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The application\u2019s backend must support asynchronous message queuing through a JMS-compliant interface.\n\n*Impact:* This phrasing might confuse stakeholders unfamiliar with these terms, delaying approvals.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nUse clear and straightforward language without losing technical accuracy:\n\n**6. Failing to Include Rationale**\n\nWhen the purpose of a requirement isn\u2019t clear, it leaves room for misinterpretation or challenges during implementation.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall log every user action.\n\n*Impact:* Developers might implement extensive logging that impacts performance because the reason for detailed logs isn\u2019t explained.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nInclude rationale:\n\n**7. Not Regularly Reviewing Requirements**\n\nRequirements that are not [reviewed and updated](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-overcome-developmental-challenges-optimizing-review-cycles-for-regulated-industries/) throughout the project lifecycle risk becoming outdated or incomplete.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\nFailing to account for regulatory changes that require adjustments to existing requirements.\n\n*Impact:* This can lead to costly rework if requirements need updates late in the development process.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nSchedule regular reviews with key stakeholders to ensure requirements remain relevant and consistent with the project\u2019s goals.\n\n**8. Over-Engineering the Requirements**\n\nIncluding excessive detail or edge cases in requirements can burden the development process and extend timelines unnecessarily.\n\n**Example Mistake**\n\n*Requirement:* The system shall display 20 different font styles for every text field customization.\n\n*Impact:* Overly complex requirements can divert resources from critical functionality and strain timelines.\n\n**How to Avoid**\n\nFocus on core needs and gather user feedback to determine reasonable scopes.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Ubiquitous Requirements", "level": 4, "content": "The first of these archetypes is the ubiquitous requirement.\n\nUbiquitous functional requirements are always active.

Be consistent in the use of modal verbs", "level": 4, "content": "A modal verb, modal or modal auxiliary is a word such as \u201cshall,\u201d \u201cmust,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d or \u201cshould\u201d which is used with a\u00a0main\u00a0verb to express\u00a0ideas\u00a0such as necessity, intention, expectation, recommendation, or possibility.\n\nIn engineering specifications, modal verbs are used to distinguish between binding requirements, non-binding recommendations, and the expected behavior of the system\u2019s operational environment. As such, it is important that requirements authors be consistent in their use of modal verbs and that they convey to developers, testers, quality assurance engineers, and regulatory authorities exactly how each modal verb is intended to be interpreted within their specification.\n\nThe use of modal verbs in specifications has long been a subject of debate in the SE/RE community. The consensus, however, is that \u201cshall\u201d and \u201cmust\u201d are the best modal verb choices for expressing requirements, while \u201cwill\u201d should be used to express expected external behavior or declarations of purpose. Non-binding recommendations or provisions can be expressed with \u201cshould\u201d or \u201cmay.\u201d\n\nAlso, many organizations use the word \u201cmust\u201d to express constraints and certain quality and performance requirements (non-functional require\u00adments). The use of \u201cmust\u201d allows them to express constraints without resorting to passive voice and to easily distinguish between functional requirements (expressed with \u201cshall\u201d) and non-func\u00adtional requirements (expressed with \u201cmust\u201d).\n\nIt is good SE/RE practice to define exactly how certain terms will be used within the document itself, and how they should be interpreted when found in non-requirements documents refer\u00adenced by the document. This is usually done in a dedicated section toward the beginning of the specification.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "2. Tag each requirement with a unique identifier", "level": 4, "content": "Another SE/RE best practice is to tag each requirement with a unique ID number or code.\n\nIn fact, requirement identifiers are often a requirement them\u00adselves.

High-level requirements are often tested by inspection or through user testing and thus may be broad in scope. Lower-level requirements that will be verified through software testing or system integration testing will necessarily be specified to a finer degree of detail.\n\nFor example, a best practice for ensuring testability is to specify a maximum reaction time for any output the software must produce in response to a specific input condition, as in this example:\n\n*3.8.5.3.1: The Engine Monitor shall set  to TRUE within 0.5 seconds when  equals or exceeds 215\u00b0 F.*", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "6.

Yet these often lead to poorly managed requirements, thus eliminating and exceeding any cost benefit the tools themselves have. Requirements end up captured in a variety of documents and spreadsheets supplemented by post-it notes in unmanaged versions with no traceability or reuse.

Karl Wiegers is an independent consultant and not an employee of Jama Software. He can be reached at\u00a0**ProcessImpact.com**.*\n\n*In this chapter, we discuss accurately measuring requirements and why disciplined organizations collect a focused set of metrics about all projects.*\n\nThese metrics provide insight into the size of the product; the effort, time, and money that the project or individual tasks consumed; the project status; and the product\u2019s quality. Because requirements are an essential project component, you should measure several aspects of your requirements engineering activities. In this chapter, adapted from Karl Wiegers book, *More about Software Requirements*, we cover several meaningful metrics related to requirements activities on your projects.\n\n### Product Size\n\nThe most fundamental metric is the number of requirements in a body of work. Your project might represent requirements by using a mix of use cases, functional requirements, user stories, feature descriptions, event-response tables, and analysis models. However, the team ultimately implements functional requirements, descriptions of how the system should behave under specific conditions.\n\nBegin your requirements measurement by simply counting the individual functional requirements that are allocated to the baseline for a given product release or development iteration. If different team members can\u2019t count the requirements and get the same answer, you have to wonder what other sorts of ambiguities and misunderstandings they\u2019ll experience. Knowing how many requirements are going into a release will help you judge how the team is progressing toward completion because you can monitor the backlog of work remaining to be done. If you don\u2019t know how many requirements you need to work on, how will you know when you\u2019re done?\n\nOf course, not all functional requirements will consume the same implementation and testing effort. If you\u2019re going to count functional requirements as an indicator of system size, your analysts will need to write them at a consistent level of granularity. One guideline is to decompose high-level requirements until the child requirements are all individually testable. That is, a tester can design a few logically related tests to verify whether a requirement was correctly implemented. Count the total number of child requirements, because those are what developers will implement and testers will test. Alternative requirements sizing techniques include use case points and story points. All of these methods involve estimating the relative effort to implement a defined chunk of functionality.\n\nFunctional requirements aren\u2019t the whole story, of course. Stringent nonfunctional requirements can consume considerable design and implementation effort. Some functionality is derived from specified nonfunctional requirements, such as security requirements, so those would be incorporated appropriately into the functional requirement size estimate. But not all nonfunctional requirements will be reflected in this size estimate. Be sure to consider the impact of nonfunctional requirements upon your effort estimate. Consider the following situations:\n\n- If the user must have multiple ways to access specific functions to improve usability, it will take more development effort than if only one access mechanism is needed.\n- Imposed design and implementation constraints, such as multiple external interfaces to achieve compatibility with an existing operating environment, can lead to a lot of interface work even though you aren\u2019t providing additional new product functionality.\n- Strict performance requirements might demand extensive algorithm and database design work to optimize response times.\n- Rigorous availability and reliability requirements can imply significant work to build in failover and data recovery mechanisms, as well as having implications for the system architecture you select.\n\nYou\u2019ll also find it informative to track the growth in requirements as a function of time, no matter what requirements size metric you use. One of my clients found that their projects typically grew in size by about twenty-five percent before delivery. Amazingly, they also ran about twenty-five percent over the planned schedule on most of their projects. Coincidence? I think not.\n\n### Requirements Quality\n\nConsider collecting some data regarding the quality of your requirements. Inspections of requirements specifications are a good source of this information. Count the requirements defects you discover and classify them into various categories: missing requirements, erroneous requirements, unnecessary requirements, incompleteness, ambiguities, and so forth. Use defect type frequencies and root-cause analysis to tune up your requirements processes so the team makes fewer of these types of errors in the future. For instance, if you find that missing requirements are a common problem, your elicitation approaches need some adjustments. Perhaps your business analysts aren\u2019t asking enough questions or the right questions, or maybe you need to engage more appropriate user representatives in the requirements development process.\n\nIf the team members don\u2019t think they have time to inspect all their requirements documentation, try inspecting a sample of just a few pages. Then calculate the average defect density\u2014the number of defects found per specification page\u2014for the sample. Assuming that the sample was representative of the entire document (a big assumption), you can multiply the number of uninspected pages by this defect density to estimate the number of undiscovered defects that could still lurk in the specification. Less experienced inspectors might discover only, say, half the defects that actually are present, so use this estimated number of undiscovered defects as a lower bound. Inspection sampling can let you assess the document\u2019s quality so that you can determine whether it\u2019s cost effective to inspect the rest of the requirements specification. The answer will almost certainly be yes.\n\nAlso, keep records of requirements defects that are identified after the requirements are baselined, such as requirements-related problems discovered during design, coding, and testing. These represent errors that leaked through your quality control filters during requirements development. Calculate the percentage of the total number of requirements errors that the team caught at the requirements stage. Removing requirements defects early is far cheaper than correcting them after the team has already designed, coded, and tested the wrong requirements.\n\nTwo informative metrics to calculate from inspection data are\u00a0*efficiency and effectiveness*. Efficiency refers to the average number of defects discovered per labor hour of inspection effort. Effectiveness refers to the percentage of the defects originally present in a work product that was discovered by inspection. Effectiveness will tell you how well your inspections (or other requirements quality techniques) are working. Efficiency will tell you what it costs you, on average, to discover a defect through inspection. You can compare that cost with the cost of dealing with requirements defects found later in the project or after delivery to judge whether improving the quality of your requirements is cost effective.\n\nThe second article in this series will address metrics related to requirements status, change requests, and the effort expended on requirements development and management activities.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Product Size Requirements Quality](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/product-size-requirements-quality)\n\n### Requirements Status\n\nTrack the status of each requirement over time to monitor overall project status, perhaps defining a requirement attribute to store this information. Status tracking can help you avoid the pervasive \u201cninety percent done\u201d problem of software project tracking. Each requirement will have one of the following statuses at any time.\n\n- Proposed (someone suggested it)\n- Approved (it was allocated to a baseline)\n- Implemented (the code was designed, written, and unit tested)\n- Verified (the requirement passed its tests after integration into the product)\n- Deferred (the requirement will be implemented in a future release)\n- Deleted (you decided not to implement it at all)\n- Rejected (the idea was never approved)\n\nOther status options are possible, of course. Some organizations use a status of \u201cReviewed\u201d because they want to confirm that a requirement is of high quality before allocating it to a baseline. Other organizations use \u201cDelivered to Customer\u201d to indicate that a requirement has actually been released.\n\nWhen you ask a developer how he is coming along, he might say, \u201cOf the eighty-seven requirements allocated to this subsystem, sixty-one of them are verified, nine are implemented but not yet verified, and seventeen aren\u2019t yet completely implemented.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance that not all these requirements are the same size, will consume the same amount of implementation effort, or will deliver the same customer value. If I were a project manager, though, I\u2019d feel that we had a good handle on the size of that subsystem and how close we were to completion. This is far more informative than, \u201cI\u2019m about ninety percent done. Lookin\u2019 good!\u201d\n\n### Requests for Changes\n\nMuch of requirements management involves handling requirement additions, modifications, and deletions. Therefore, track the status and impact of your requirements change requests. The data you collect should let your team answer questions such as the following:\n\n- How many change requests were submitted in a given time period?\n- How many of these requests are open, and how many are closed?\n- How many requests were approved, and how many were rejected?\n- How much effort did the team spend implementing each approved change?\n- How long have the requests been open on average?\n- On average, how many individual requirements or other artifacts are affected by each submitted change request?\n\n![Image](https://static.jamasoftware.com/www/imports/2013/09/a18f2.jpg)\n\nMonitor how many changes are incorporated throughout development after you baselined the requirements for a specific release. Note that a single change request potentially can affect multiple requirements of different levels and types (user requirements, functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements). To calculate requirements volatility over a given time period, divide the number of changes by the total number of requirements at the beginning of the period (for example, at the time a baseline was defined):\n\nThe intent is not to try to eliminate requirements volatility. There are often good reasons to change requirements. However, we need to ensure that the project can manage the degree of requirements changes and still meet its commitments. Changes become more expensive as the product nears completion, and a sustained high level of approved change requests makes it difficult to know when you can ship the product. Most projects should become more resistant to making changes as development progresses, meaning the trend of accepted changes should approach zero as you near the planned completion date for a given release. An iterative development approach gives the team multiple opportunities to incorporate changes into subsequent iterations, while still keeping each iteration on schedule.\n\nIf you receive many change requests, that suggests that elicitation overlooked many requirements or that new ideas keep coming in as the project drags along month after month. Record where the change requests come from: marketing, users, sales, management, developers, and so on. The change request origins will tell you who to work with to reduce the number of overlooked, modified, and misunderstood requirements.\n\nChange requests that remain unresolved for a long time suggest that your change management process isn\u2019t working well. I once visited a company where a manager wryly admitted that they had enhancement requests that were several years old and still pending. This team should allocate a certain number of their open requests to specific planned maintenance releases and convert other long-term deferred change requests to a status of rejected. This would help the project manager focus the team\u2019s energy on the most important and most urgent items in the change backlog.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Status Request Changes](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/status-requests-changes)\n\n### Effort\n\nFinally, we recommend that you record the time your team spends on requirements engineering activities. These activities include both requirements development (getting and writing good requirements) and requirements management (dealing with change, tracking status, recording traceability data, and so on).\n\nI\u2019m frequently asked how much time and effort a project should allocate to these functions. The answer depends enormously on the type and size of project, the developing team and organization, and the application domain. If you track your own team\u2019s investment in these critical project activities, you can better estimate how much effort to plan for future projects.\n\nSuppose that on one previous project, your team expended ten percent of its effort on requirements activities. In retrospect, you conclude that the requirements were too poorly defined and the project would have benefited from additional investment in developing quality requirements. The next time your team tackles a similar project, the project manager would be wise to allocate more than ten percent of the total project effort to the requirements work.\n\nAs you accumulate data, correlate the project development effort with some measure of product size. The documented requirements should give you an indication of size. You could correlate effort with the count of individually testable requirements, use case points, function points, or something else that is proportional to product size. As Figure 1 illustrates, such correlations provide a measure of your development team\u2019s productivity, which will help you estimate and scope individual release contents. If you collect some product size data and track the corresponding implementation effort, you\u2019ll be in a better position to create meaningful estimates for similar projects in the future.\n\n![Image](https://static.jamasoftware.com/www/imports/2013/09/a18f1.jpg)\n\nFigure 1.

It\u2019s mostly a matter of developing a simple infrastructure for collecting and analyzing the data, and getting team members in the habit of recording some key bits of data about their work.

He can be reached at\u00a0**ProcessImpact.com**.*\n\n*In this chapter, we discuss accurately measuring requirements and why disciplined organizations collect a focused set of metrics about all projects.*\n\nThese metrics provide insight into the size of the product; the effort, time, and money that the project or individual tasks consumed; the project status; and the product\u2019s quality. Because requirements are an essential project component, you should measure several aspects of your requirements engineering activities. In this chapter, adapted from Karl Wiegers book, *More about Software Requirements*, we cover several meaningful metrics related to requirements activities on your projects.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Product Size", "level": 3, "content": "The most fundamental metric is the number of requirements in a body of work. Your project might represent requirements by using a mix of use cases, functional requirements, user stories, feature descriptions, event-response tables, and analysis models. However, the team ultimately implements functional requirements, descriptions of how the system should behave under specific conditions.\n\nBegin your requirements measurement by simply counting the individual functional requirements that are allocated to the baseline for a given product release or development iteration. If different team members can\u2019t count the requirements and get the same answer, you have to wonder what other sorts of ambiguities and misunderstandings they\u2019ll experience. Knowing how many requirements are going into a release will help you judge how the team is progressing toward completion because you can monitor the backlog of work remaining to be done. If you don\u2019t know how many requirements you need to work on, how will you know when you\u2019re done?\n\nOf course, not all functional requirements will consume the same implementation and testing effort. If you\u2019re going to count functional requirements as an indicator of system size, your analysts will need to write them at a consistent level of granularity. One guideline is to decompose high-level requirements until the child requirements are all individually testable. That is, a tester can design a few logically related tests to verify whether a requirement was correctly implemented. Count the total number of child requirements, because those are what developers will implement and testers will test. Alternative requirements sizing techniques include use case points and story points. All of these methods involve estimating the relative effort to implement a defined chunk of functionality.\n\nFunctional requirements aren\u2019t the whole story, of course. Stringent nonfunctional requirements can consume considerable design and implementation effort. Some functionality is derived from specified nonfunctional requirements, such as security requirements, so those would be incorporated appropriately into the functional requirement size estimate. But not all nonfunctional requirements will be reflected in this size estimate. Be sure to consider the impact of nonfunctional requirements upon your effort estimate. Consider the following situations:\n\nYou\u2019ll also find it informative to track the growth in requirements as a function of time, no matter what requirements size metric you use. One of my clients found that their projects typically grew in size by about twenty-five percent before delivery. Amazingly, they also ran about twenty-five percent over the planned schedule on most of their projects. Coincidence? I think not.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Requirements Quality", "level": 3, "content": "Consider collecting some data regarding the quality of your requirements. Inspections of requirements specifications are a good source of this information. Count the requirements defects you discover and classify them into various categories: missing requirements, erroneous requirements, unnecessary requirements, incompleteness, ambiguities, and so forth. Use defect type frequencies and root-cause analysis to tune up your requirements processes so the team makes fewer of these types of errors in the future. For instance, if you find that missing requirements are a common problem, your elicitation approaches need some adjustments. Perhaps your business analysts aren\u2019t asking enough questions or the right questions, or maybe you need to engage more appropriate user representatives in the requirements development process.\n\nIf the team members don\u2019t think they have time to inspect all their requirements documentation, try inspecting a sample of just a few pages. Then calculate the average defect density\u2014the number of defects found per specification page\u2014for the sample. Assuming that the sample was representative of the entire document (a big assumption), you can multiply the number of uninspected pages by this defect density to estimate the number of undiscovered defects that could still lurk in the specification. Less experienced inspectors might discover only, say, half the defects that actually are present, so use this estimated number of undiscovered defects as a lower bound. Inspection sampling can let you assess the document\u2019s quality so that you can determine whether it\u2019s cost effective to inspect the rest of the requirements specification. The answer will almost certainly be yes.\n\nAlso, keep records of requirements defects that are identified after the requirements are baselined, such as requirements-related problems discovered during design, coding, and testing. These represent errors that leaked through your quality control filters during requirements development. Calculate the percentage of the total number of requirements errors that the team caught at the requirements stage. Removing requirements defects early is far cheaper than correcting them after the team has already designed, coded, and tested the wrong requirements.\n\nTwo informative metrics to calculate from inspection data are\u00a0*efficiency and effectiveness*. Efficiency refers to the average number of defects discovered per labor hour of inspection effort. Effectiveness refers to the percentage of the defects originally present in a work product that was discovered by inspection. Effectiveness will tell you how well your inspections (or other requirements quality techniques) are working. Efficiency will tell you what it costs you, on average, to discover a defect through inspection. You can compare that cost with the cost of dealing with requirements defects found later in the project or after delivery to judge whether improving the quality of your requirements is cost effective.\n\nThe second article in this series will address metrics related to requirements status, change requests, and the effort expended on requirements development and management activities.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Product Size Requirements Quality](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/product-size-requirements-quality)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Requirements Status", "level": 3, "content": "Track the status of each requirement over time to monitor overall project status, perhaps defining a requirement attribute to store this information. Status tracking can help you avoid the pervasive \u201cninety percent done\u201d problem of software project tracking. Each requirement will have one of the following statuses at any time.\n\nOther status options are possible, of course. Some organizations use a status of \u201cReviewed\u201d because they want to confirm that a requirement is of high quality before allocating it to a baseline. Other organizations use \u201cDelivered to Customer\u201d to indicate that a requirement has actually been released.\n\nWhen you ask a developer how he is coming along, he might say, \u201cOf the eighty-seven requirements allocated to this subsystem, sixty-one of them are verified, nine are implemented but not yet verified, and seventeen aren\u2019t yet completely implemented.\u201d There\u2019s a good chance that not all these requirements are the same size, will consume the same amount of implementation effort, or will deliver the same customer value. If I were a project manager, though, I\u2019d feel that we had a good handle on the size of that subsystem and how close we were to completion. This is far more informative than, \u201cI\u2019m about ninety percent done. Lookin\u2019 good!\u201d", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Requests for Changes", "level": 3, "content": "Much of requirements management involves handling requirement additions, modifications, and deletions. Therefore, track the status and impact of your requirements change requests. The data you collect should let your team answer questions such as the following:\n\n![Image](https://static.jamasoftware.com/www/imports/2013/09/a18f2.jpg)\n\nMonitor how many changes are incorporated throughout development after you baselined the requirements for a specific release. Note that a single change request potentially can affect multiple requirements of different levels and types (user requirements, functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements). To calculate requirements volatility over a given time period, divide the number of changes by the total number of requirements at the beginning of the period (for example, at the time a baseline was defined):\n\nThe intent is not to try to eliminate requirements volatility. There are often good reasons to change requirements. However, we need to ensure that the project can manage the degree of requirements changes and still meet its commitments. Changes become more expensive as the product nears completion, and a sustained high level of approved change requests makes it difficult to know when you can ship the product. Most projects should become more resistant to making changes as development progresses, meaning the trend of accepted changes should approach zero as you near the planned completion date for a given release. An iterative development approach gives the team multiple opportunities to incorporate changes into subsequent iterations, while still keeping each iteration on schedule.\n\nIf you receive many change requests, that suggests that elicitation overlooked many requirements or that new ideas keep coming in as the project drags along month after month. Record where the change requests come from: marketing, users, sales, management, developers, and so on. The change request origins will tell you who to work with to reduce the number of overlooked, modified, and misunderstood requirements.\n\nChange requests that remain unresolved for a long time suggest that your change management process isn\u2019t working well. I once visited a company where a manager wryly admitted that they had enhancement requests that were several years old and still pending. This team should allocate a certain number of their open requests to specific planned maintenance releases and convert other long-term deferred change requests to a status of rejected. This would help the project manager focus the team\u2019s energy on the most important and most urgent items in the change backlog.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Status Request Changes](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/measuring-requirements/status-requests-changes)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Effort", "level": 3, "content": "Finally, we recommend that you record the time your team spends on requirements engineering activities. These activities include both requirements development (getting and writing good requirements) and requirements management (dealing with change, tracking status, recording traceability data, and so on).\n\nI\u2019m frequently asked how much time and effort a project should allocate to these functions. The answer depends enormously on the type and size of project, the developing team and organization, and the application domain. If you track your own team\u2019s investment in these critical project activities, you can better estimate how much effort to plan for future projects.\n\nSuppose that on one previous project, your team expended ten percent of its effort on requirements activities. In retrospect, you conclude that the requirements were too poorly defined and the project would have benefited from additional investment in developing quality requirements. The next time your team tackles a similar project, the project manager would be wise to allocate more than ten percent of the total project effort to the requirements work.\n\nAs you accumulate data, correlate the project development effort with some measure of product size. The documented requirements should give you an indication of size. You could correlate effort with the count of individually testable requirements, use case points, function points, or something else that is proportional to product size. As Figure 1 illustrates, such correlations provide a measure of your development team\u2019s productivity, which will help you estimate and scope individual release contents.

It lays the important groundwork so that every person involved with the project understands the most crucial details.\n\nAn SRS outlines the behaviors, [functions,](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/functional-requirement-vs-non-functional-requirements/)\u00a0and capabilities required of the system, along with any potential constraints.\u00a0[Functional](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/functional-requirements/)\u00a0and\u00a0[nonfunctional](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/non-functional-requirements/)\u00a0requirements are included.\u00a0Design suggestions\u00a0and information outside the customer\u2019s requirements are not included.\n\nApproval is received from all necessary stakeholders, showing that they clearly understand the project requirements and everyone agrees. In a sense, the SRS functions as an insurance policy that any party can refer to in case of uncertainty.\n\n### Why Use SRS Documents?\n\nUsing\u00a0an\u00a0SRS ensures that specifics around a project are crystal clear, reducing the risk of rework and wasted time. Important benefits of using this type of document include:\n\n- **Providing Valuable Customer Feedback.** An SRS is the customer\u2019s confirmation that your organization understands the problems that need to be solved and how the software must behave to address the challenges. Visuals such as charts and tables can provide additional clarity.\n- **Breaking Work Into Smaller Pieces.** An SRS contains a large amount of information, but they ultimately break problems into smaller, more manageable parts.\n- **Serving\u00a0as a Parent Document.\u00a0**The SRS serves as a parent document to any additional documents that follow its creation. The scope of work, software design specifications, and other documents often leverage what is highlighted in the\u00a0SRS. Plus, it can serve as a product validation check. Did we do it right? Check the\u00a0SRS.\n\nThe\u00a0SRS assists with\u00a0identifying\u00a0problems earlier in the\u00a0development\u00a0process, which helps manage time more effectively.

A good SRS needs to answer a few critical questions, such as:\n\n- What should the software do?\n- How should it behave?\n- What are the\u00a0performance\u00a0requirements?\n- Are there any constraints that need to be noted?\u00a0And if so, what are they?\n\nA good starting point is an\u00a0SRS\u00a0outline.\u00a0A rough outline of\u00a0the various sections\u00a0can help you get\u00a0ready\u00a0to fill in the important details.\u00a0Consider\u00a0the following:\n\n- **Create an Introduction.**\u00a0The introduction addresses what the software needs to do\u00a0(and what it should not do). The development team and product owners should be involved in writing this part of the plan. Why does the product need to be\u00a0built? What challenges does it solve? And who is going to use the product?\u00a0Additionally,\u00a0the SRS introduction might contain\u00a0an overview of what is included within the document.\n- **Write a General Description.**\u00a0Focus\u00a0on\u00a0the functionality\u00a0of the\u00a0product. Define the required hardware and\u00a0user\u00a0interfaces. What do end users expect\u00a0the\u00a0software\u00a0to do?\u00a0What are\u00a0the\u00a0various\u00a0functionalities?\u00a0Ultimately, this section\u00a0will\u00a0focus\u00a0on system\u00a0interfaces, user interfaces, hardware interfaces, software interfaces and more. Additionally, any\u00a0important\u00a0assumptions\u00a0need to be included.\n- **Include Specific R****equirement Specifications****.** This section examines specific details about the product so it\u2019s easier to design and validate that it has met requirements. It describes all inputs that the software must handle, highlights any required outcomes, and clearly defines any necessary integrations. Performance criteria should also be included, as well as any software system attributes, such as readability, availability, security, profitability, and more.\n\nOnce you have the basic outline, you can start filling it out with the help of your team and customer. Upon completion, get final approval. Everyone important to the project needs to review and approve the final version of the SRS.\n\nThe optimal organization of the requirements within an SRS can vary greatly, depending on the system being developed, so there isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all template. However, a general software requirements specification template such as [this one](https://gephi.org/users/gephi_srs_document.pdf) can be used to create the \u201cbones\u201d of your document. You can then fill in the details as you go.\n\n#### What Mistakes Shouldbe Avoided When Building a System Requirements Specification?\n\nAs you become more experienced at SRS development, the process will become much faster. When starting out, however, it helps to have a list of common mistakes to avoid. Consider the following:\n\n- Failing to Include a Complete Dictionary. Does your SRS include jargon that only people in a specific industry understand? If so, create a dictionary section for easy viewing and include definitions of any terms not commonly understood.\u00a0\n\nCreating Confusion by Mixing Concepts.\u00a0Keep your document organized and be careful to present information to readers in a logical flow.\u00a0Avoid mixing concepts throughout\u00a0the document so that you don\u2019t create confusion.\nNot Fully Understanding the End User.\u00a0Who will interact with the software, and what are the expected results? For example, imagine that an application is supposed to generate reports. Some requirements may address how the user will click on a specific button to generate various reports. Ensure that you know what is expected from the report generation software, but also know who\u00a0is clicking on that button\u00a0so you\u00a0better understand the user and the required functionality.\u00a0\u00a0\nBeing Ambiguous. Ensure that your requirements can\u2019t be misinterpreted. An SRS is designed to prevent misunderstanding, so make sure the document doesn\u2019t generate it. For every functionality or situation description, make sure that you don\u2019t present features that have not yet been defined.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)\n\n### How Can Software Streamline the Creation of an SRS?\n\nResources that assist with simplifying requirement specifications\u00a0are\u00a0helpful in writing your\u00a0SRS.\u00a0For example,\u00a0[Jama Connect](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/)\u00a0is a hub\u00a0designed to\u00a0follow\u00a0your complete product development life\u00a0cycle, enabling product managers\u00a0and\u00a0engineers\u00a0to track requirements,\u00a0decisions,\u00a0and relationships on multiple levels\u00a0and\u00a0deliver compliant, market-driven products effectively.\n\nJama Connect helps teams deliver high-quality products on time and on budget by aligning\u00a0stakeholders, identifying risks early on,\u00a0and visualizing connections between regulations, requirements,\u00a0and test cases throughout the development process.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a solution to simplify SRS creation, make sure your chosen solution provides:\n\n- **Confidence.\u00a0**[Traceability\u00a0of requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/requirements-traceability/)\u00a0should be apparent throughout the entire development process,\u00a0[highlighting potential risk](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/traceability-matrix-101-why-its-not-the-ultimate-solution-for-managing-requirements/)\u00a0and allowing you to proceed with confidence.\n- **Visibility.\u00a0**The solution should offer visibility into the product development process by monitoring relationships and dependencies between systems, teams, activities, and results.\n- **Speed.\u00a0**Speedy alignment should be provided, which assists with tracking decisions, increasing efficiency, and minimizing reworking to create high-quality products on time and on budget.\n- **Adaptability.\u00a0**Make sure the solution\u00a0easily adapts to your organization\u2019s\u00a0workflows,\u00a0creating\u00a0an\u00a0intuitive\u00a0experience for your teams to get up to speed fast.\n- **Performance.** Make sure the system provides benchmarks and monitors team performance over time to better understand the benefits of retooling your product development process.\n\nOverall, you want to make sure that any software that assists with streamlining the creation of\u00a0SRS equips\u00a0your team with the ability to analyze impacts, track decisions and ensure the quality of the product you set out to build.\n\n#### Moving Forward With Greater Success\n\nDesigning\u00a0a robust\u00a0SRS\u00a0ensures that you have a \u201cgo-to\u201d document for your entire development project.

These requirements serve as the blueprint for project development, ensuring that stakeholders are aligned, and expectations are met. In this article, we will delve into the concept of business requirements, elucidating their significance and providing real-world examples to illuminate their application.\n\n### Understanding Business Requirements\n\nBusiness requirements are essential components that outline the needs, objectives, and expectations of a project.

He is known internationally for his requirements training, coaching, and consulting.\n\n### Requirements Engineering Foundations and Inherent Challenges\n\nRequirements engineering (RE) is a human-centered activity and is fundamentally about communication. In some ways RE is straightforward: you need to work out who will be affected by a product, system or service, find out what they want it to do and document it. You will need to manage their expectations about what can be achieved. Once the solution is built, you need to check that it does what the people asked for. This sounds simple but is not necessarily easy.\n\nRE is a cross-discipline activity and includes both soft skills and technical aspects. No two developments are the same; the scale, complexity, risk, novelty, and the composition of the project team all vary between projects. When developing new products, systems or services, there is much that is unknown and must be discovered. Because of these and many other factors, RE is not an exact science; it is not a completely systematic and repeatable \u201cengineering process.\u201d Successful RE follows a reusable approach for efficiency but is not a copy-exact process. RE processes must be adapted or customized for the nuance of each individual development program.\n\n### Inherent Challenges\n\nThere are many challenges in collecting a set of requirements for a new product, system or service. People do not always know what they want, so the requirements may not be readily available; they may have to be discovered. Even if they know what they want, people may find it difficult to express the requirements clearly. Individuals all have different experiences and make assumptions based on what they already know. Consequently, people typically do not state things that seem obvious to them. Additionally, people do not always know what is possible, so they would not think to ask it.\n\nFor any new development project, there are almost always more stakeholders than is first obvious. Requirements come from a wide range of stakeholders who will be affected in some way by the proposed new product, system or service. Even \u201cusers\u201d are not a homogeneous group; they will have differing levels of knowledge and experience and will want to use the new system to achieve many objectives. A development team will typically include software, hardware, safety, verification, maintenance and support engineers, project managers and administrative staff. The wider project will involve a project sponsor, product managers, consultants, customers, suppliers, regulators and the public. All these diverse roles may have requirements on the product, system or service. Even the roles included here do not constitute an exhaustive list of stakeholders.\n\nStakeholders may have high-level aspirations, wishes, wants and needs that they hope a future system or product can address. However, these goals should not be captured as \u201crequirements\u201d because they are typically not things that a system can deliver. It is wise to capture and document stakeholder goals, but it is important also to manage stakeholder expectations about what the proposed system can actually achieve. Stakeholder goals will always include conflicts, so goals cannot ever be completely satisfied. The set of system requirements, however, must be complete, consistent and free of conflict; it must be possible to build a system that satisfies all the system requirements.\n\nTo undertake requirements engineering (RE) activities effectively and reduce project risk, you need people, processes, and technology to work together to capture the requirements and communicate clearly to all relevant stakeholders throughout the entire system development process.\n\nThis chapter will discuss some of the issues that arise during RE and describe how the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) Syntax notation helps achieve desired outcomes and overcome many common development challenges by enabling you to improve your requirements engineering practices.\n\n### Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax\n\nThe Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) uses a few keywords and a simple underlying ruleset to gently constrain natural language (NL) requirements. EARS requirements have a few clauses that are always in the same order, following temporal logic. This means that the requirements mirror common usage of English whilst optimizing clarity and precision. EARS requirements are therefore intuitively simple to understand.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development)\n\n### The EARS Origins\n\nEARS was first developed in 2009 at Rolls-Royce Aero Engines. A group of cross-discipline engineers analyzed an airworthiness regulation to determine the requirements for an aero engine control system. The team looked at each clause of the regulatory document and decided whether it explicitly or implicitly inferred a requirement on the engine control system. For each clause that included a requirement, an initial set of \u201crules\u201d was used to clarify and simplify the requirement. The rules were refined iteratively during the analysis. During this analysis, it became clear that the resultant requirements were all syntactically similar and followed one of a small number of patterns. This work led to the publication of the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax paper at the IEEE \u201cRE09\u201d International Requirements Engineering conference.\n\nEARS recognizes the fact that most requirements are written in natural language (NL) and that many requirement authors are not formally trained in writing system requirements. However, problems in system requirements tend to propagate through system development. This can lead to problems such as increased volatility and risk, which can impact quality, program schedule and cost. EARS has been shown to reduce or even eliminate many of the common problems in NL requirements. EARS is lightweight and requires little training overhead. EARS is therefore easy to adopt, which makes it popular with practitioners. EARS is widely used by organizations including Bosch, Daimler, Dyson, Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce and Siemens and is also taught at numerous universities worldwide.\n\n### The EARS Pattern\n\nThe clauses of an EARS requirement always appear in the same order. The basic structure of an EARS requirement is: **While, when, the shall **\n\nThe EARS ruleset states that a requirement must have: Zero or many preconditions; Zero or one trigger; One system name; One or many system responses. Applying the EARS notation produces requirements in a small number of patterns, depending on the clauses that are used. Each of the EARS patterns are explained below.\n\n- Ubiquitous requirements are always active and have the following structure: **The shall ** for example *The mobile phone shall have a mass of less than XX grams.*\n- State driven requirements are active as long as the specified state remains true, are denoted by the keyword While and have the following syntax **While , the shall ** for example *While there is no card in the ATM, the ATM shall display \u201cinsert card to begin\u201d.*\n- Event driven requirements specify how a system must respond when a triggering event occurs, are denoted by the keyword When and have the following syntax **When , the shall ** for example: *When \u201cmute\u201d is selected, the laptop shall suppress all audio output.*\n- Optional feature requirements apply in products or systems that include the specified feature, are denoted by the keyword Where and have the following syntax **Where , the shall ** for example: *Where the car has a sunroof, the car shall have a sunroof control panel on the driver door.*\n- Unwanted behavior requirements are used to specify the required system response to undesired situations, are denoted by the keywords If and Then and have the following syntax **If , then the shall ** for example: *If an invalid credit card number is entered, then the website shall display \u201cplease re-enter credit card details\u201d.*\n- The simple building blocks of the EARS patterns can be combined to specify requirements for richer system behaviour. Requirements that include more than one EARS keyword are called Complex requirements and have the following syntax **While , When , the shall ** for example: *While the aircraft is on ground, when reverse thrust is commanded, the engine control system shall enable reverse thrust.* Complex requirements for unwanted behavior also include the If-Then keywords.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Write an Effective Product Requirements Document](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-an-effective-product-requirements-document)\n\n### Ten\u202fKey\u202fBenefits of\u202fusing EARS\n\nUsing\u202fEARS helps align people, process and technology very early in the system development process, even before you have fully defined your processes or selected tools, but applying\u202fEARS\u202fhas numerous\u202fadditional\u202fbenefits.\n\n1. EARS reduces or even eliminates common errors typically found in textual NL\u202frequirements.\n2. EARS requirements\u202fare simpler and more consistent, even if written by different authors.\u202fThe simplicity means that EARS requirements are universally understandable, even to those who may not have\u202fbeen trained in the EARS notation.\u202fThis consistency\u202falso\u202fensures each requirement is judged equally, free of any style or presentation bias. EARS has been shown to be especially effective for those whose first language is not English, but who must write in English.\n3. Little training is needed; many\u202forganizations\u202ftrain EARS in half a day or even less\u202fand see an immediate improvement is the standard of written requirements. Since EARS is close to natural language, there is no new notation to learn.\u202fEARS requirements are easier to review than those written in a more specialist notation.\u202fEARS requirements are\u202fsimilar\u202fin style\u202fto test cases, which in\u202fturn\u202fmeans that\u202fsystems are easier to verify against EARS requirements.\n4. EARS helps\u202fboth novice and experienced\u202frequirement\u202fauthors, since both groups\u202ftend to write\u202fbetter requirements more quickly.\u202fMost requirements are written iteratively; draft requirements are\u202felaborated and improved over several iterations.\u202fWhen using EARS, first draft requirements tend to be much closer to the finished requirement.\n5. EARS works well\u202falongside\u202fa range of\u202fmodels\u202fincluding\u202factivity diagrams and state charts, since the\u202felements of an EARS requirement are also found in such models.\u202fEARS is\u202fan\u202feffective means to gently introduce rigor into requirements and systems engineering processes; this has been called\u202f\u201cstealth\u202frigor.\u201d\n6. Many of the benefits of EARS\u202fwork at both individual and team level. Individuals write better requirements, but the consistency\u202fof EARS requirements\u202fhas\u202fwider\u202fbenefits across a project team, throughout\u202fan\u202forganization\u202fand even into the supply chain. Requirements are more\u202fwidely and more\u202feasily understood. Intra-team\u202fcommunication is improved, and\u202fteam members are more portable across projects. EARS helps to\u202fbuild teams, generates a shared understanding and therefore\u202freduces\u202fsilo mentality.\u202fThis\u202freduces project risk because\u202fmissing information is identified\u202fearlier,\u202fand\u202frequirements\u202fare written more precisely.\n7. When a project team starts\u202fusing EARS, something magical can happen. Since the use of EARS clarifies and simplifies the\u202fsyntax\u202fof requirements, it frees up\u202fcognitive capacity to consider the\u202fsemantics\u202fof a requirement. In layman\u2019s terms, this means that people\u202fno longer need\u202fto think about structure, but instead they concentrate on meaning.\u202fBecause certain elements are necessary to\u202fwrite an\u202fEARS\u202frequirement, it is obvious to authors when this information is missing.\u202fFor example,\u202fa requirement author may know that a system must exhibit certain behavior, but they do not (yet) know how this behavior will be initiated.\u202fThis will prompt the author to investigate the circumstances that should\u202fcause the system response; this could be a triggering event or a precondition.\n8. The characteristics of EARS mean that development teams more quickly identify what is not yet known, but that must be identified to complete the requirements. Where other notations may hide missing or incomplete information in ambiguous requirements statements, EARS exposes what must be discovered. EARS therefore empowers teams to \u201cstart before the beginning.\u201d\n9. Even before you have fully defined your processes or selected tools, as mentioned,\u202fEARS helps align people, process and technology very early in the system development process,\u202feven before you have fully defined your development processes or selected tools. Once your team knows\u202fEARS, they know the elements needed to generate requirements. So even in the earliest stages of a project,\u202fthey will be gathering the essential elements needed to write good requirements. If something is not known that is needed for an EARS requirement, it is obvious that something is missing and that this element needs to be discovered. EARS\u202ftherefore\u202faids the whole scope of system engineering.\n10. EARS can be used effectively without any tool support since the requirements are essentially in (gently constrained) natural language. However, for more complex projects, particularly with large or distributed project teams, it can be advantageous to have some tool support. One such tool,\u202f[Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/)\u202ffor Requirements, Risk, and Test Management, can be used effectively to help establish and extend your team\u2019s use of the EARS notation. In addition,\u202fJama Software Requirements Advisor\u202fcan optimize your usage of the EARS notation with suggested advice on EARS usage.\n\nA senior engineer at a major engineering company once said: \u201cIf you can\u2019t write it in EARS, then you don\u2019t understand it.\u201d This emphasizes a hidden strength of EARS; it prevents authors from writing incomplete requirements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n*\u201cIn theory there is no difference between theory and practice, but in practice there is\u201d (Yogi Berra)*\n\nIn theory, Requirements Engineering is quite easy, but in practice it is quite difficult. One way to make it easier for yourself is to use EARS.\n\nEARS is a lightweight approach that is easy to learn, provides a quick return on investment, and is popular with users because it is intuitive and mirrors normal use of English. For distributed teams, bigger teams, and more complex projects, it can be advantageous to have some sort of tool support such as [Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/) and Jama Software Requirements Advisor which provides\u202fassessments on the use of EARS.\n\nEARS notation is simple and effective, with known elements needed to complete a finished requirement. The team therefore wastes no time on deciding **how** to write and instead, is able to use all their energy and cognitive effort on **what** to write. The emphasis shifts to the semantics (meaning) of the requirement \u2013 what do we want the system/product to actually do.\n\nCoupled with a requirements management platform like Jama Connect, the EARS approach can improve product requirements and align teams, processes, and technology by enabling more effective and efficient communication within and across teams. This alignment creates better synergy allowing teams to focus on the quality of output, thereby reducing overall project risk.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss Lessons for Reducing Risk in Product Development.\n\nDEFINITION OF EARS:\n\n** Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS)** uses a few keywords and a simple underlying ruleset to gently constrain natural language (NL) requirements\n\nPREVIOUSFunctional requirements examples and templates\n\nNEXT UPJama Connect Advisor\u2122\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

In some ways RE is straightforward: you need to work out who will be affected by a product, system or service, find out what they want it to do and document it. You will need to manage their expectations about what can be achieved. Once the solution is built, you need to check that it does what the people asked for. This sounds simple but is not necessarily easy.\n\nRE is a cross-discipline activity and includes both soft skills and technical aspects. No two developments are the same; the scale, complexity, risk, novelty, and the composition of the project team all vary between projects. When developing new products, systems or services, there is much that is unknown and must be discovered. Because of these and many other factors, RE is not an exact science; it is not a completely systematic and repeatable \u201cengineering process.\u201d Successful RE follows a reusable approach for efficiency but is not a copy-exact process. RE processes must be adapted or customized for the nuance of each individual development program.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Inherent Challenges", "level": 3, "content": "There are many challenges in collecting a set of requirements for a new product, system or service. People do not always know what they want, so the requirements may not be readily available; they may have to be discovered. Even if they know what they want, people may find it difficult to express the requirements clearly. Individuals all have different experiences and make assumptions based on what they already know. Consequently, people typically do not state things that seem obvious to them. Additionally, people do not always know what is possible, so they would not think to ask it.\n\nFor any new development project, there are almost always more stakeholders than is first obvious. Requirements come from a wide range of stakeholders who will be affected in some way by the proposed new product, system or service. Even \u201cusers\u201d are not a homogeneous group; they will have differing levels of knowledge and experience and will want to use the new system to achieve many objectives. A development team will typically include software, hardware, safety, verification, maintenance and support engineers, project managers and administrative staff. The wider project will involve a project sponsor, product managers, consultants, customers, suppliers, regulators and the public. All these diverse roles may have requirements on the product, system or service. Even the roles included here do not constitute an exhaustive list of stakeholders.\n\nStakeholders may have high-level aspirations, wishes, wants and needs that they hope a future system or product can address. However, these goals should not be captured as \u201crequirements\u201d because they are typically not things that a system can deliver. It is wise to capture and document stakeholder goals, but it is important also to manage stakeholder expectations about what the proposed system can actually achieve. Stakeholder goals will always include conflicts, so goals cannot ever be completely satisfied. The set of system requirements, however, must be complete, consistent and free of conflict; it must be possible to build a system that satisfies all the system requirements.\n\nTo undertake requirements engineering (RE) activities effectively and reduce project risk, you need people, processes, and technology to work together to capture the requirements and communicate clearly to all relevant stakeholders throughout the entire system development process.\n\nThis chapter will discuss some of the issues that arise during RE and describe how the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) Syntax notation helps achieve desired outcomes and overcome many common development challenges by enabling you to improve your requirements engineering practices.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax", "level": 3, "content": "The Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) uses a few keywords and a simple underlying ruleset to gently constrain natural language (NL) requirements. EARS requirements have a few clauses that are always in the same order, following temporal logic.

EARS requirements are therefore intuitively simple to understand.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "The EARS Origins", "level": 3, "content": "EARS was first developed in 2009 at Rolls-Royce Aero Engines. A group of cross-discipline engineers analyzed an airworthiness regulation to determine the requirements for an aero engine control system. The team looked at each clause of the regulatory document and decided whether it explicitly or implicitly inferred a requirement on the engine control system. For each clause that included a requirement, an initial set of \u201crules\u201d was used to clarify and simplify the requirement. The rules were refined iteratively during the analysis. During this analysis, it became clear that the resultant requirements were all syntactically similar and followed one of a small number of patterns. This work led to the publication of the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax paper at the IEEE \u201cRE09\u201d International Requirements Engineering conference.\n\nEARS recognizes the fact that most requirements are written in natural language (NL) and that many requirement authors are not formally trained in writing system requirements. However, problems in system requirements tend to propagate through system development. This can lead to problems such as increased volatility and risk, which can impact quality, program schedule and cost. EARS has been shown to reduce or even eliminate many of the common problems in NL requirements. EARS is lightweight and requires little training overhead. EARS is therefore easy to adopt, which makes it popular with practitioners. EARS is widely used by organizations including Bosch, Daimler, Dyson, Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce and Siemens and is also taught at numerous universities worldwide.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "The EARS Pattern", "level": 3, "content": "The clauses of an EARS requirement always appear in the same order.

EARS requirements have a few clauses that are always in the same order, following temporal logic. This means that the requirements mirror common usage of English whilst optimizing clarity and precision.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll present a list of frequently asked questions about the EARS notation and Jama Connect Advisor for Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n### 1: Why is it important to write good requirements?\n\nWell-written requirements are critical for the development of any successful system. Requirements drive the design, development, and user experience of the system. Well-written requirements can improve productivity and quality. A good requirement states something that is necessary, verifiable, and attainable.\n\n### 2: Is my requirement data secure?\n\nYes. Jama Connect Advisor uses the same portfolio of security solutions as the production release of Jama Connect.\n\n- Your requirements statements stay within the Jama Connect Cloud with the same proven protection of Jama Connect.\n\n### 3: What are the benefits of Jama Connect Advisor\u2122 for Jama Connect\u00ae?\n\n- Improve the quality of your requirements statements quickly and efficiently using natural language processing.\n- Reduce the risk of late-stage errors.\n- Assists development teams in standardizing your process for requirement authoring, saving time, and enhancing accuracy.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [All Systems Go: INCOSE Principals](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/all-systems-go-incose-principals)\n\n### 4: How are requirements statements evaluated?\n\nAdvisor applies industry best-known methods from both INCOSE* and EARS*. Please review the details that follow on both below.\n\n### 5: What is INCOSE?\n\nInternational Council for Systems Engineering (INCOSE) is a not-for-profit membership organization founded in 1990 with the following goals:\n\n- Develop and disseminate the interdisciplinary principles and practices that enable the realization of successful systems.\n- Promote international collaboration in systems engineering practice, education, and research.\n- Assure the establishment of competitive, scale-able professional standards in the practice of systems engineering.\n- Encourage governmental and industrial support for research and educational programs that will improve the systems engineering process and its practice.\n- Learn more about INCOSE\n\n### 6: Why use INCOSE rules?\n\nINCOSE reflects the principles and processes of system engineering. [The INCOSE\u202f Guide for Writing Requirements](https://requirements.com/Content/Articles-Posts/5-incose-guidelines-that-every-requirement-engineer-should-know)\u202f focuses on writing requirements in the context of systems engineering. It emphasizes the need to consider the context of the system of interest when writing requirements. Considering the environment in which the developed system is located is an integral part of the system approach.\n\n### 7: What is the INCOSE Guide for Writing Requirements?\n\nINCOSE created and published the first\u202f Guide for Writing Requirements\u202fin July 2009. Since then, the document has undergone several reprints, which incorporated the suggestions and comments of various practitioners. The latest version of the guide, (V3) at the time of this writing, was published in June 2019.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development)\n\n### 8: What is EARS?\n\nAlistair Mavin, \u201cMav,\u201d the originator of the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) describes it as follows:\n\nEARS is a mechanism to gently constrain written requirements. The EARS patterns provide structured guidance that enables authors to write high-quality requirements.\n\nMav and his colleagues at Rolls-Royce PLC developed EARS while analyzing the airworthiness regulations for a jet engine\u2019s control system. The regulations contained high-level objectives, a mixture of implicit and explicit requirements at different levels, lists, guidelines, and supporting information.\n\nIn the process of extracting and simplifying the requirements, Mav noticed that the requirements all followed a similar structure. He found that requirements were easiest to read when the clauses always appeared in the same order. These patterns were refined and evolved to create EARS.\n\nThere is a set syntax (structure), with an underlying ruleset. A small number of keywords are used to denote the different clauses of an EARS requirement. The clauses are always in the same order, following chronological logic. The syntax and the keywords closely match common usage of English and are therefore intuitive.\n\nThe notation was first published in 2009 and has been adopted by many organizations across the world.\n\n[Learn more about EARS](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)\n\n### 9: Why use EARS notation?\n\nSystem requirements are usually written in unconstrained natural language (NL), which is inherently imprecise. Often, requirements authors are not trained in how to write requirements. During system development, requirements problems spread to lower levels. This creates unnecessary volatility and risk, impacting program schedule and cost.\n\nEARS reduces or even eliminates common problems found in natural language requirements. It is especially effective for requirements authors who must write requirements in English, but whose first language is not English. EARS has proven popular with practitioners because it is lightweight, there is little training overhead, no specialist tool is necessary, and the resulting requirements are easy to read.\n\n[Learn more about these patterns](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Write an Effective Product Requirements Document](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-an-effective-product-requirements-document)\n\n### 10: Who is using EARS?\n\nEARS is used worldwide by large and small organizations in different domains. These include blue-chip companies such as Airbus, Bosch, Dyson, Honeywell, Intel, NASA, Rolls-Royce, and Siemens.\n\nThe notation is taught at universities around the world including in France, Sweden, UK, and USA.\n\n### 11: What are EARS patterns?\n\nFollowing are six fundamental EARS patterns:\n\n- Ubiquitous requirements\n- State-driven requirements\n- Event-driven requirements\n- Complex\n- Option feature requirements\n- Unwanted behavior requirements\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss Adopting EARS Notation to Improve Requirements Engineering\n\nDEFINITION OF EARS\n\n** The Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS) ** uses a few keywords and a simple underlying ruleset to gently constrain natural language (NL) requirements. EARS requirements have a few clauses that are always in the same order, following temporal logic.

The regulations contained high-level objectives, a mixture of implicit and explicit requirements at different levels, lists, guidelines, and supporting information.\n\nIn the process of extracting and simplifying the requirements, Mav noticed that the requirements all followed a similar structure. He found that requirements were easiest to read when the clauses always appeared in the same order. These patterns were refined and evolved to create EARS.\n\nThere is a set syntax (structure), with an underlying ruleset. A small number of keywords are used to denote the different clauses of an EARS requirement. The clauses are always in the same order, following chronological logic. The syntax and the keywords closely match common usage of English and are therefore intuitive.\n\nThe notation was first published in 2009 and has been adopted by many organizations across the world.\n\n[Learn more about EARS](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "9: Why use EARS notation?", "level": 3, "content": "System requirements are usually written in unconstrained natural language (NL), which is inherently imprecise. Often, requirements authors are not trained in how to write requirements. During system development, requirements problems spread to lower levels. This creates unnecessary volatility and risk, impacting program schedule and cost.\n\nEARS reduces or even eliminates common problems found in natural language requirements. It is especially effective for requirements authors who must write requirements in English, but whose first language is not English. EARS has proven popular with practitioners because it is lightweight, there is little training overhead, no specialist tool is necessary, and the resulting requirements are easy to read.\n\n[Learn more about these patterns](https://alistairmavin.com/ears/)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Write an Effective Product Requirements Document](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-an-effective-product-requirements-document)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "10: Who is using EARS?", "level": 3, "content": "EARS is used worldwide by large and small organizations in different domains.

It serves as compass, roadmap, and GPS in helping guide your product to launch. Give your PRD its due attention and it will become your trusted assistant!\n\nThe PRD is a living document to which everyone on your development team contributes and refers throughout the development process.\n\nWhile a PRD can technically be maintained in any number of forms, like Word, spreadsheets, or a database, having a requirements management solution like Jama Connect offers many benefits and time saving features \u2013 we\u2019ll get into that later! But unless you\u2019re in a sector where documentation formats are prescribed by government or industry standards, your organization will need to come up with its own PRD format or template, unless assisted by a formal requirements management platform with pre-built templates. Having a standardized template ensures everyone involved in product development can easily navigate the PRD and \u201cbe on the same page\u201d with the rest of the team.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover:\n\n- What a PRD is\n- The main components of a PRD\n- Steps you should take in creating a PRD\n- The most common challenges or issues encountered when writing a PRD\n- What makes a good PRD template\n- Why develop templates\n- What is a product requirements document vs. a stakeholder needs document\n- What features do good product requirement document templates have\n- What are examples of good Agile requirements documents\n- When are documents not the right call\n- Where do templates fit into data-centric product development\n\nFinally, we\u2019ll offer information on how to build a PRD template for your team, and where you can learn more about maintaining a PRD on a [requirements management platform.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [G2 Again Names Jama Connect\u00ae the Standout Leader in Requirements Management Software in their Spring 2023 Grid\u00ae Report](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-again-names-jama-connect-the-standout-leader-in-requirements-management-software-in-their-spring-2023-grid-report)\n\n### What is a Product Requirements Document (PRD)?\n\nThe product requirements document defines:\n\n- The purpose and value proposition of a product to be developed\n- The features and functionality (i.e., the requirements) for the product\n- The goals and timeline for the product\u2019s release\n\nA PRD is not the same thing as an MRD. The MRD (marketing requirements document) is developed by the marketing department and captures what users need and want from the product. The MRD is created before the product requirements document.\n\n### PRD vs. BRD?\n\nIn product development, both a Product Requirements Document (PRD) and a Business Requirements Document (BRD) are essential components, but they serve different purposes and cater to different stakeholders.\n\n1. **Product Requirements Document (PRD):**\n\nThe PRD primarily focuses on describing what the product should do from a functional perspective. It outlines the features, functionalities, and user interactions that the product should have.\nIt is typically used by product managers, designers, and developers to understand the scope of the product and guide the development process.\nThe PRD includes details such as user stories, use cases, UI/UX design specifications, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria.\nIts primary goal is to ensure that the development team builds the right product that meets the needs of the users and aligns with the business objectives.\n2. **Business Requirements Document (BRD):**\n\nThe BRD focuses on the broader business objectives, goals, and strategies that the product aims to achieve.\nIt is used by stakeholders across different departments, including business analysts, project managers, executives, and sometimes external partners or clients.\nThe BRD includes information such as the business problem or opportunity that the product addresses, market analysis, competitive landscape, business rules, regulatory requirements, and financial considerations.\nIts primary goal is to ensure that the product aligns with the overall business strategy and objectives, and that it delivers value to the organization and its stakeholders.\n\nWhile the PRD and BRD serve distinct purposes, they are often interconnected. The PRD provides the detailed specifications necessary to meet the business requirements outlined in the BRD. Together, they provide a comprehensive framework for guiding the development and deployment of a successful product.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development)\n\n### The Main  Components of a Product Requirements Document\n\nA product requirements document has four primary components:\n\n**1. Purpose**\n\n- What problem does the product solve?\n- Who will use it?\n- How does it align with the company\u2019s strategic goals and initiatives?\n\n**2. Features**\n\n- Requirements (which define each feature)\n- Context and rationale (that help explain the requirements)\n\n**3. Release Criteria (should cover five areas)**\n\n- Functionality \u2014 minimum functionality required for release\n- Usability \u2014 how you will ensure the product is easy to use\n- Reliability \u2014 how you will determine that the system is sufficiently reliable\n- Performance \u2014 the benchmarks the product must achieve\n- Supportability \u2014 how you will ensure the product can be supported by your company\n\n**4. Timeline**\n\n- Target release window\n- Project milestones\n- Release dependencies \u2014 known factors (beyond release criteria) that may affect release\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [[Answered] The Most Asked Questions About Writing Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/answered-the-most-asked-questions-about-writing-requirements/)\n\n### The Main  Components of a Product Requirements Document\n\n#### Step 1: Do your homework\n\nTo create a great new product, you need a thorough understanding of the problem that product is going to solve. The only way to gain that understanding is by doing some homework.\n\nStudy your customers. Talk to them. Discover exactly what problem they need you to solve for them. Why does it matter to them? What is it costing them?\n\nStudy your competitors. Study their solutions to the problem. From what you\u2019ve learned from your customers, determine your competition\u2019s strengths and weaknesses when it comes to solving the problem. How can you better fill the need?\n\nConsult with marketing, sales, and your technical experts, anyone who has insight into the problem.\n\nAssess your team\u2019s capabilities. How are they equipped to tackle the problem? What technologies are they familiar with or excited about that might be useful in addressing the problem?\n\nStudy the available technologies. What are their advantages and disadvantages relative to solving the problem?\n\nThe purpose of all this homework is to prepare yourself to lead your product development team. When you know what you\u2019re talking about, you\u2019ll project confidence. That will inspire confidence in your team, and prepare all of you to face the challenges ahead.\n\n#### \n\n#### Step 2: Define your product\u2019s purpose\n\nUsing what you\u2019ve learned in Step 1, you\u2019ll now fill in the first section of the PRD in this and the next two steps.\n\nYou need to establish a clear, concise *value proposition* that succinctly communicates the need the product will fill and spells out how the product aligns with your company\u2019s overall objectives and product strategy. Hone this value proposition down to an \u201celevator pitch\u201d that can be recited in under one minute.\n\nProvide guidance that will help the team make tradeoffs during the design and implementation of the product Make it clear to everyone what a successful implementation of the product will deliver.\n\n#### \n\n#### Step 3: Define your product\u2019s principles\n\nEstablish a set of principles for the product that will guide the team through development.\n\nFor a medical device, for example, the principles might be:\n\n- Extremely safe\n- Highly reliable\n- Easy and intuitive to use\n\nYou may find that defining your product\u2019s principles leads you to refine and tighten up your value proposition statement. Or you might find that your principles fall simply fall out of the value proposition exercise. Either way, your product principles will act as a compass that will help guide your team as they define user tasks and product features in the next two steps.\n\n#### Step 4: Identify user profiles, goals, and tasks\n\nOnce you have defined the purpose of your product, you need to establish who you\u2019re building it for. You need a clear picture of your product\u2019s users, their goals in using the product, and the tasks they will perform with the product to accomplish those goals. This is a drill-down exercise: First define the user profile, then the goals, and finally, the tasks.\n\n**BUILD YOUR USER PROFILE**\n\nAs you begin to define your user profile, you\u2019ll probably be able to identify several potential users for your product. Out of these, you need to identify the primary user: the user who is most important to your company in terms of sales of the product.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined the primary user, build a descriptive user profile or persona. This profile will indicate the target user\u2019s gender, age, industry, job function, and other demographic data. It should also include any habits and attitudes the user has that might influence their use of your product.\n\nYour goal in building a user profile is to gain a collective understanding of where your primary user is coming from. When your team considers new features, they should ask themselves how that user would react to them and how likely they are to use them.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make your user profile as realistic and representative as you can. Team members need visualize the user. The profile should also represent the needs, desires, habits and attitudes of a solid cross-section of your primary users, so that you end up shaping your product for the majority of your primary user group and not some small niche within it.\n\nAbove all, be sure to focus only on the *primary* user. Keep secondary users out of the discussion. It is impossible to please everyone, so don\u2019t even try. Optimize for your primary user.\n\n**IDENTIFY USER GOALS**\n\nOnce you have your primary user profile, identify that user\u2019s main objectives in using the product. What does he or she need to accomplish?\n\nBe aware that when you speak to users, they may tell you the solution they think they want rather than their goals. Users often have a tough time disentangling what they want to accomplish from how they go about accomplishing it. This is important, because there are likely much better ways to solve their problem than what they have in mind.\n\nYou need to give designers and engineers freedom to find the best solution. Keep your focus on determining exactly what the user needs to accomplish and what obstacles are standing in their way.\n\n**IDENTIFY USER TASKS**\n\nFinally, work with your team to design tasks to help users accomplish their goals.\n\nEncourage creativity and innovation during this exercise. Try to envision ways the user can accomplish their goals quickly and easily. Then, evaluate alternatives against one another.\n\nNote: *tasks are not features.* Features support tasks and are defined later. Features should map through tasks to higher-level goals.\n\n#### Step 5: Specify your product\u2019s features.\n\nNow, your team is going to start filling in what will be the bulk of your PRD. In this section, you will describe each feature in terms of its functionality. You will describe any constraints that have been placed upon the design of the product. You should also note any assumptions made while defining your requirements.\n\nThe product\u2019s **functionality** will be expressed in what are known as **functional requirements.** Functional requirements dictate what the product must do. They must not, however, dictate how the product does that. The \u201chow\u201d will be determined during product design and development.\n\nIt is important that the requirements not dictate the implementation or bias it toward one solution or another. Only with \u201csolution-agnostic\u201d requirements will your designers and engineers be free to find a solution that is optimized toward accomplishing the user\u2019s goals.\n\nThe product\u2019s **constraints** will be expressed in what are known as **non-functional requirements.** Non-functional requirements capture any restrictions or limitations that have been placed on the product\u2019s design by stakeholders.\n\nConstraints often specify compatibility needs. Users may need the product to run a specific platform, for example. Your company or customers may need the product to interface with one or more of their existing systems. Constraints may be used to indicate the limits of a product\u2019s operating environment\u2014 temperature ranges and other environmental conditions the product must withstand.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Decision Accountability: Three Ways Traceability Evolved to Make Complex Decisions Possible](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/decision-accountability-three-ways-traceability-evolved-to-make-complex-decisions-possible)\n\nYou may find it helpful to structure the description of each feature by breaking it up into parts within your template. Your \u201cfeature template\u201d might include:\n\n- Description\n- Purpose\n- User problem and task(s) the feature addresses\n- Functionality\n- Constraints\n- Assumptions\n- Design (preliminary wireframes or mockups)\n- Not doing (anything not to be included in the release)\n- Acceptance criteria\n\nFinally, go back and question your assumptions. Have you fully identified all the assumptions you\u2019ve made? Are those assumptions valid? Have forgotten anything? It is very easy to make assumptions without even being aware of them. Review your requirements to make sure they\u2019re solution-agnostic.\n\n#### \n\n#### Step 6: Prototype and test your concept\n\nProduct managers and developers often make the mistake of having too much confidence in their PRD once they\u2019ve finished drafting it. The problem is that by the time Beta feedback arrives, it\u2019s too late to make major changes.\n\nThe remedy for this problem is to perform product validation testing using prototypes. Modern prototyping tools make this easier than ever.\n\nProduct validation testing is typically broken down into three types: feasibility testing, usability testing, and product concept testing.\n\n**FEASIBILITY TESTING**\n\nFeasibility testing involves building a prototype or model, and then examining it to determine whether it is feasible to build.\n\nGet your engineers, architects, and designers involved. Explore available technologies and possible approaches. Identify obstacles and evaluate their severity. Are they insurmountable? It\u2019s better to know now.\n\n**USABILITY TESTING**\n\nUsability testing is a highly effective way to get feedback from your target customer. It often identifies missing requirements or requirements that are less necessary than originally supposed.\n\nYou and your designers will need to come up with ways of presenting the functionality so users can understand how to use the product. Plan on running multiple iterations before you arrive at a satisfactory user experience.\n\n**PRODUCT CONCEPT TESTING**\n\nKnowing your product is feasible and usable is not enough. What\u2019s most important is to make sure people will actually buy it. For that, you need to get your product in front of real users and determine if it actually helps them accomplish their goals in a satisfying way. That\u2019s where product concept testing comes in.\n\nProduct concept testing can normally be combined with usability testing. To accomplish this goal, however, it\u2019s very important that the prototype be highly realistic. Fortunately, today\u2019s prototyping tools make this not only possible, but fast and easy as well.\n\n**FOLD IN YOUR FEEDBACK**\n\nAs you test your product concept, update your requirements based on the feedback you\u2019ve gained. The importance of this step cannot be overemphasized. Most engineering errors originate in the requirements, and the cost of correcting those errors rises dramatically once implementation begins.\n\n#### Step 7: Establish release criteria and timeline\n\nOnce you\u2019ve established and validated your requirements, it\u2019s important to prioritize and rank them and to set your goals for the release.\n\nMany product managers prioritize features by tagging them with labels, such as \u201cmust have,\u201d \u201chigh want,\u201d and \u201cnice to have.\u201d But it\u2019s also important to rank order each requirement within those categories. There are two reasons for this.\n\nThe first is time to market. Schedules often slip. When they do, you may need to trim features and requirements to meet your release date. You don\u2019t want your team implementing the easiest requirements first only to find that there\u2019s not enough time to complete all your must-haves.\n\nThe second reason is that requirements evolve. During implementation, you\u2019re likely to discover new needs. Some may be critically important and supersede existing requirements in terms of priority. You need to know where those new requirements fit in with your pecking order. If you don\u2019t, less important factors will determine what gets implemented first, which may have a negative impact on your product\u2019s success.\n\nBesides prioritizing requirements, you should also establish some quantifiable *metrics for success* that will establish the fitness of your product for release. Your success metrics may include measurements for:\n\n- Performance\n- Reliability\n- Usability\n- Safety\n- Supportability\n- Scalability\n- Localizability\n- Other factors relevant to your product\n\n#### \n\n#### Step 8: Review and revise your draft PRD\n\nBefore you start implementation, test your PRD for completeness.\n\nGet all your stakeholders involved. They should make sure the PRD addresses their needs and concerns. Do the developers fully understand the problem to be solved? Does QA have enough information to build a test plan and write test cases?\n\nOnce you\u2019ve addressed any issues your stakeholders have identified, you\u2019ll have a PRD from which you can begin to build a product.\n\n#### \n\n#### Step 9: Manage product development\n\nOver the course of product development, countless issues over requirements (or the lack thereof) will arise. Always refer to the PRD. If the answer isn\u2019t there, resolve the issue and record the decision.\n\nYour PRD is a living document. Use it to track all your features and requirements throughout development and product launch.\n\nAbove all, keep it accurate. Doing so will simplify preparation for milestone reviews. Plus, your whole team will have a clear picture of what you\u2019re all aiming for.\n\nDoes your organization struggle with writing requirements? Teams can now author requirements quickly, easily, efficiently, and with precision by leveraging the power of natural language (NL) processing.\u00a0 [Learn more about Jama Connect Advisor\u2122 HERE](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/jama-connect-advisor)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

You\u2019ll quickly see the issues they have and how to address them.\n\nHere are some important points to keep in mind when planning and performing usability testing:\n\n- Do usability testing during requirements development, not during implementation\n- Plan on multiple iterations\n- Make sure the project manager and designer are present for most if not all sessions\n- Invite other internal stakeholders to observe (can be eye-opening)\n- Pay attention to what users do, rather than what they say\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure why users are doing something, ask, but it\u2019s more important to observe their interactions with the product. If you don\u2019t have usability engineers in your organization, you may want to contract with a firm that specializes in usability to run this testing.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #2: You are not your customers\n\nCustomers are seldom as immersed in technology as product creators. Often, functionality that seems obvious and intuitive to those who design a product can seem obtuse and counterintuitive to potential users who are exposed to it for the first time. A poor first impression can sour a potential customer on your product.\n\nYou must perform reality checks of your product with real users on an ongoing basis. Do they understand how it works? Will they use it? Will they value it? Customer feedback during development is invaluable.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #3: Solution favoritism\n\nWhen writing requirements, you must specify what the product must do (the problem to be solved), NOT how the product will do it (the solution). It is important not to bias requirements toward one solution or another.\n\nThere are two pitfalls with solution-biased requirements.\n\nFirst, engineers my make incorrect assumptions. There can be many different solutions to the same problem. Some will be better than others. Incorrect assumptions may exclude the best of those solutions, closing doors to innovation.\n\nSecond, you risk frustrating the development team. Your engineers are paid to come up with a solution, which they then must implement and maintain. They\u2019re the folks who will have to live with it and support it. Engineers want autonomy to be innovative. They tend to resent specifications that read like a recipe.\n\nEnsure that every requirement in the PRD is clearly stating what the product must do, but not dictating the solution itself.\n\n#### Challenge #4: Too little detail\n\nWhile you want to give engineers and designers plenty of leeway to find the best solution, you still need to fully specify the product.\n\nIf there are gaps in your PRD, you may pay a heavy price down the road. Team members are likely to make assumptions to fill in the gaps. Different team members will likely make different assumptions. Problems no one anticipated may rear their ugly heads late in the game when it\u2019s far more expensive to correct them.\n\nThe best safeguard against this is to have the team review drafts of the PRD early and often. Address all questions and resolve them in the PRD. Plan on problems cropping up during development. Allocate time for addressing them. Update the PRD as they are resolved.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #5: Too much detail\n\nToo much detail can be just as bad as too little. If the PRD becomes a massive tome, team members will lose patience and won\u2019t read it. This can lead to more assumptions.\n\nRemember that the PRD is a top-level document. Use the appropriate level of detail. If your product is highly complex you may need lower-level documents, like software requirements specifications, for each of your subsystems.\n\nState requirements succinctly. Segregate explanatory text and keep that succinct as well. Add only what is necessary for context. If you find you are having issues in writing succinct requirements, or team members are constantly asking for clarification, you may want to consider a [rigorous requirements syntax like EARS.](https://qracorp.com/easy-approach-to-requirements-syntax-ears-guide/)\n\n#### Challenge #6: Feature overload\n\nYou want your product appeal to as many customers and users as possible. So, it can be tempting to add features to meet everyone\u2019s needs and desires. Unfortunately, especially with high-tech products, adding features is often counterproductive.\n\nPiling on features adds complexity to the product. That can make some features harder to find and lead to user confusion. An overabundance of features also drives up maintenance costs and customer support costs.\n\nBe judicious in adding features. Exercise discipline. The tech world is littered with products that started off great, then became so bloated that customers abandoned them. They no longer served their purpose as well as they did when they were new and lean.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #7: Engineering-driven requirements\n\nYour engineering team may be enamored with an emerging technology they want to work with. They may be excited by a challenging problem they want to solve. This can lead them to overwhelm the product manager with requirements, effectively dictating the solution they want to build.\n\nProduct managers should listen to engineering needs but focus on value. They need to define a product that customers will buy and that\u2019s feasible to build, one that can be executed on time with a strong effort. They can\u2019t let engineers build whatever they want or something that can\u2019t be achieved within program\u2019s time constraints.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #8: Marketing-driven requirements\n\nSales and marketing also want a say in product definition. They maintain close contact with their best customers. They have first-hand knowledge of what customers want, and they\u2019re charged with selling that.\n\nOne way this becomes a problem is with what are called \u201cspecials.\u201d Someone at your company promises a customer a special version of your product with new features the customer requested. Typically, this is done in exchange for additional purchases or fees.\n\nSpecials create several issues for your company.\n\nFirst, the additional features create add complexity which can lead to customer confusion and frustration, as we discussed earlier under Challenge #6 (feature overload).\n\nSecond, you wind up with multiple versions of the product that you now must build, test, maintain and support. All that added task can bog down engineering and prevent your company from pursuing more profitable work.\n\nFinally, customers often struggle to articulate what they need. The requested features may have been a stab at what they think they want. Once they receive their new features, users may find they don\u2019t meet their needs after all.\n\nTo avoid this pitfall, be disciplined. Evaluate the value of each proposed feature. Know when to walk away and be willing to do so.\n\nBetter yet, make sure your standard product is useful and compelling enough that customers can live without custom features. Get those valued customers involved in product concept and usability testing. Dig deep to get at what they really need.\n\n#### \n\n#### Challenge #9: Traceability\n\nFinally, your PRD doesn\u2019t just track your product\u2019s requirements. It needs mechanisms for tracking issues, test cases, bugs, and problem resolution to each requirement as well. It must support requirement traceability.\n\nImplementing traceability can be complicated and tedious in a Word document or spreadsheet. A dedicated requirements management tool, like Jama Connect, can greatly facilitate requirements traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Complete Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-complete-guide-to-the-systems-engineering-body-of-knowledge-sebok)\n\n### What makes a good PRD template?\n\nIdentifying what makes a good PRD is one thing \u2014 actually creating one is much more challenging. Many teams look for online templates, but while those can be a useful starting point, they may not be the best fit for every team or product. Each team and product is unique, and it is entirely possible that the team will need to either create its own template or tailor an existing one to meet their needs before writing the PRD. The contents and organization of the data and information contained in a PRD will be different for each organization depending on their product line, culture, and product development processes \u2013 one size doesn\u2019t fit all! The tables below show some example PRD templates that various organizations have used. Table 1 shows generic sections, Table 2 expands the design input requirements section 3.2.x.\n\n![PRD](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/PRD-Table-1.png) ![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/PRD-Table-2.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Complete Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-complete-guide-to-the-systems-engineering-body-of-knowledge-sebok)\n\n### Features of a Good Product Requirement Document Template\n\nGood PRD templates will follow a logical progression that takes you from product idea to design and all the way through to final product release. Your PRD template might vary a bit in language or definition, but it should include the following elements in roughly the progression indicated:\n\n- The objective: Who is this for? What personas or use cases are relevant? How does the product align with strategic initiatives?\n- Release details: Include milestones, dependencies, name, release date, and other details relevant to product launch.\n- Features of the product: This piece will obviously be the bulk of your PRD. Name and describe the features, their purpose, and the problems the features solve. Do not include items that are outside of the scope for each feature.\n- Wireframes and mockups: A picture is worth a thousand words, as they say. Use visual elements to help define user flow and design.\n- Analytics: Use this section to establish expectations for your product. Be as specific as possible. For example, \u201cwe believe changing the chat interface will improve customer satisfaction\u201d is less specific than \u201cwe believe redesigning the chat interface to blue on white will increase our NPS score by 1 \u2013 2 points.\u201d\n- Future plans: Assume the best\u2014your product will be a success, and you\u2019ll need to build on that success going forward! What future work, plans, and goals might result from a successful product launch?\n\n### Why develop PRD templates?\n\nIf you\u2019re not using a formal requirements management solution that automates the majority of this work, having a standard template tailored to your product line facilitates some reuse and provides a checklist that helps ensure completeness. A template should be generic for all products developed within your organization, but tailorable for specific types of products per the needs of individual projects.\n\nPRD templates can contain more than just an outline. They can contain \u201cboiler plate\u201d text that is common across the product lines. In addition, it is common to have a common set of requirements that apply to many of the products developed by the organization such as quality requirements, safety and security requirements, user interface requirements for displays and controls, and requirements dealing with standards and regulations.\n\nStarting from a PRD template allows project team members to focus on defining requirements that are to be contained within the PRD rather than first having to invent an outline for organizing those needs and requirements. Once such templates have been developed, they can be reused for future projects. Having a standard organization for your requirements makes it easier to find information within the documents. The standard outline, boilerplate text, and requirements common to the product line can also be used as a checklist to prevent omissions.\n\nWhile you can use a PRD template for reuse across multiple projects, if this template lives in Word documents or spreadsheets, you\u2019ll still be working against version control issues and lengthy, confusing documents. Learn more about why Word and Excel are not enough to manage complex requirements [in this video.](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/wb-2021-12-14-why-excel-and-word-are-not-enough)\n\n### What is a product requirements document vs. a stakeholder needs document?\n\nBefore creating or tailoring a PRD template, it\u2019s important to understand what exactly a PRD is and what its purpose is.\n\nA PRD is written to define the product technical design input requirements. The PRD should communicate what, who, and how. What the purpose of the document and the product is, who it is for, and how it will result in the stakeholders\u2019 needs being met. Some organizations may refer to the PRD as a Product Requirement Specification (PRS), a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), a System Requirements Document (SRD), or System Design Specification (SDS).\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the PRD is not the same as the Stakeholders Needs Document (SND). Ideally, the SND should come first, as it is focused on the customers\u2019, users\u2019, and other key stakeholders\u2019 needs and wants. Like the PRD, *some organizations may refer to the SND by various names: Marketing Requirements Document (MRD); Stakeholder Requirements Document (SRD), Business Requirements Document (BRD), Scope Definition Document (SDD), Product Concept Document (PCD), etc. The name is not as important as the contents.)*\n\nAny successful product development effort must begin with the customer and other key stakeholders\u2019 needs in mind. What problem is the product to address? What are the vision, goals, and objectives that define the expected outcomes? What are the drivers and constraints? Budget and schedule? What are the use cases and operational scenarios? What capabilities, features, performance, and level of quality do the stakeholders need? What are the safety and security risks associated with the use of the product that must be addressed? What standards and regulations apply? Is what is being asked for feasible?\n\nThese are some of the questions that must be addressed and documented within the SND at the beginning of the project. It is important to understand the stakeholder\u2019s perspective of what they need and expect from the product before defining the technical design input requirements. The integrated set of needs documented within the SND will be transformed into the requirements for inclusion in the PRD. The requirements in the PRD communicate to the development team what the product must do to meet the needs of customers, users, and other stakeholders.\n\nLearn more about defining and [managing requirements.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-management/)\n\n### What are examples of good Agile requirements documents?\n\nIn general, the focus of Agile development results in Agile project teams avoiding documents as a formal method of communicating needs and requirements. Agile projects do address the information traditionally contained within SNDs (Stakeholders Need Document) and PRDs as described above, but in less formal forms relying on frequent interactions between team members and customers, progressing in \u201csprints.\u201d The team will define, informally, the expectations and desired outcomes for each sprint.\n\nHowever, many organizations will define a high-level set of project expectations, needs, and requirements in what some call an Agile Requirements Document (ARD). The information is high-level identifying the problem to be solved, the purpose, vision, goals, and objectives for the product, key drivers and constraints, high-level use cases, capabilities, features, performance expected, compliance requirements, etc.\n\nThe purpose of the ARD is to communicate a high-level definition for the Agile project team that bounds the scope of the project. The ARD is used to kick off the project, communicating high-level customer expectations which product acceptance will be based. At this level of communication, normally the contents of the ARD do not change once they are baselined and the project is initiated. The details for addressing the vision, goals, objectives, needs, and requirements within the ARD are left up to the Agile team.\n\nBecause of the nature of Agile product development, templates for SND and PRD type documents are not applicable. Agile teams must be flexible and respond quickly to changing requirements. For scrum teams, the short sprints and quick turnarounds mean there is little time to create documents, much less keep them updated and maintained.\n\nTeams working under Agile guidelines need to be able to remain nimble, which means avoiding the use of documents. In an agile environment, a team may have a short timeline for a sprint to complete a feature or new release. Adding the development of formal documents to this short process will only add an unnecessary layer of work and complication.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices Guide to Requirements & Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/guide-to-requirements-and-requirements-management)\n\n### When are documents not the right call?\n\nHistorically, non-Agile product development projects define and record the data and information associated with the various product development artifacts in the form of \u201cdocuments\u201d like a SND or PRD as discussed above. However, using a document-centric approach has many disadvantages for today\u2019s products.\n\nAs products become more complex and regulated, the sheer volume of documentation can be overwhelming; especially in terms of configuration management, change control, and change impact assessment across the product lifecycle. Often, many of the documents are developed and managed by different, geographically separated organizational units in silos with limited collaboration.\n\nIn a document-centric approach, it is nearly impossible to keep all the data and information contained within the various documents synchronized, current, correct, and consistent. As a result, there is no real single source of truth (SSoT). For example, needs and requirements for the product may be undergoing change, making the maintenance of the data and information within the documents cumbersome and time-consuming. For highly regulated products, the amount of documentation that must be developed, maintained, and supplied to regulators to show compliance has become overwhelming. Inconsistencies in these documents can result in a product that is not approved for use.\n\nThe cost and time overhead associated with managing changes to the data and information within the documents consumes a large part of development cost, eating into profit margins. The time overhead often results in longer development times and time to market, making a company less competitive. Additionally, quality suffers resulting in post-product launch costs associated with increased returns for reimbursement, recalls, warranty work, and company image degradation associated with negative social media comments \u2014 all of which also eat into profits. A highly regulated product that is not approved for use can cause a company\u2019s stock price to plummet and, in some cases, push the company into bankruptcy.\n\nAs valuable as documents like the SND or PRD can be, managing the needs and requirements in document form has shortcomings like those discussed above. When change happens, the project team needs an effective method to assess how each change affects other artifacts across the lifecycle.\n\nTo effectively develop and manage these complex, highly regulated products, organizations need to transition to a requirements management software platform such as [Jama Connect](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/) allowing project teams to enable Live Traceability\u2122 in order to establish a SSoT, establish traceability across the product lifecycle, and manage and assess change.\n\nEven for less complex products, using documents as the primary form to record data and information typically contained within a PRD may not be the right call. If teams are widely dispersed, keeping these documents current, in sync, and consistent may be challenging, even if they are stored in the cloud.\n\n### Where do templates fit into data-centric product development?\n\nThe need for and benefits of templates discussed above apply equally to data-centric product development using a requirements management software platform like Jama Connect. The difference is that the organization of data and information is defined in terms of specific types of data and information in a form that supports traceability. A \u201cschema\u201d is defined concerning the various types of data and information and their relationships.\n\nRather than documents, needs and requirements are organized in \u201csets.\u201d You establish an integrated set of stakeholder needs rather than an SND and sets of requirements corresponding to the product architecture rather than a PRD and other requirements documents.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean there will not be documents. While the SSoT is maintained within the data and information stored and managed within the software application, documents can be created as \u201creports.\u201d Each report can have a template defined within the software application with the same characteristic discussed earlier.\n\nUsing this approach, the SSoT is maintained within the requirements management software application, not the report that is an output of the application. Users of these types of documents need to understand that the currency of the data in the \u201cdocument\u201d is only valid at the time the document was output from the application.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [[Webinar Recap] Managing Mission Critical Requirements in an Agile Environment](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/webinar-recap-managing-mission-critical-requirements-in-an-agile-environment)\n\n### Closing Thoughts\n\nProduct development teams know that the difference between a good product and a great product or a good launch and a great launch is often in the planning. Starting with clear definitions and descriptions, tracing requirements throughout development, and staying flexible enough to adapt to change along the way are all key.

This is a drill-down exercise: First define the user profile, then the goals, and finally, the tasks.\n\n**BUILD YOUR USER PROFILE**\n\nAs you begin to define your user profile, you\u2019ll probably be able to identify several potential users for your product. Out of these, you need to identify the primary user: the user who is most important to your company in terms of sales of the product.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve determined the primary user, build a descriptive user profile or persona. This profile will indicate the target user\u2019s gender, age, industry, job function, and other demographic data. It should also include any habits and attitudes the user has that might influence their use of your product.\n\nYour goal in building a user profile is to gain a collective understanding of where your primary user is coming from. When your team considers new features, they should ask themselves how that user would react to them and how likely they are to use them.\n\nIt\u2019s important to make your user profile as realistic and representative as you can. Team members need visualize the user. The profile should also represent the needs, desires, habits and attitudes of a solid cross-section of your primary users, so that you end up shaping your product for the majority of your primary user group and not some small niche within it.\n\nAbove all, be sure to focus only on the *primary* user. Keep secondary users out of the discussion. It is impossible to please everyone, so don\u2019t even try. Optimize for your primary user.\n\n**IDENTIFY USER GOALS**\n\nOnce you have your primary user profile, identify that user\u2019s main objectives in using the product. What does he or she need to accomplish?\n\nBe aware that when you speak to users, they may tell you the solution they think they want rather than their goals. Users often have a tough time disentangling what they want to accomplish from how they go about accomplishing it. This is important, because there are likely much better ways to solve their problem than what they have in mind.\n\nYou need to give designers and engineers freedom to find the best solution. Keep your focus on determining exactly what the user needs to accomplish and what obstacles are standing in their way.\n\n**IDENTIFY USER TASKS**\n\nFinally, work with your team to design tasks to help users accomplish their goals.\n\nEncourage creativity and innovation during this exercise. Try to envision ways the user can accomplish their goals quickly and easily. Then, evaluate alternatives against one another.\n\nNote: *tasks are not features.* Features support tasks and are defined later.

They must not, however, dictate how the product does that. The \u201chow\u201d will be determined during product design and development.\n\nIt is important that the requirements not dictate the implementation or bias it toward one solution or another. Only with \u201csolution-agnostic\u201d requirements will your designers and engineers be free to find a solution that is optimized toward accomplishing the user\u2019s goals.\n\nThe product\u2019s **constraints** will be expressed in what are known as **non-functional requirements.** Non-functional requirements capture any restrictions or limitations that have been placed on the product\u2019s design by stakeholders.\n\nConstraints often specify compatibility needs. Users may need the product to run a specific platform, for example. Your company or customers may need the product to interface with one or more of their existing systems. Constraints may be used to indicate the limits of a product\u2019s operating environment\u2014 temperature ranges and other environmental conditions the product must withstand.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Decision Accountability: Three Ways Traceability Evolved to Make Complex Decisions Possible](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/decision-accountability-three-ways-traceability-evolved-to-make-complex-decisions-possible)\n\nYou may find it helpful to structure the description of each feature by breaking it up into parts within your template.

The problem is that by the time Beta feedback arrives, it\u2019s too late to make major changes.\n\nThe remedy for this problem is to perform product validation testing using prototypes. Modern prototyping tools make this easier than ever.\n\nProduct validation testing is typically broken down into three types: feasibility testing, usability testing, and product concept testing.\n\n**FEASIBILITY TESTING**\n\nFeasibility testing involves building a prototype or model, and then examining it to determine whether it is feasible to build.\n\nGet your engineers, architects, and designers involved. Explore available technologies and possible approaches. Identify obstacles and evaluate their severity. Are they insurmountable? It\u2019s better to know now.\n\n**USABILITY TESTING**\n\nUsability testing is a highly effective way to get feedback from your target customer. It often identifies missing requirements or requirements that are less necessary than originally supposed.\n\nYou and your designers will need to come up with ways of presenting the functionality so users can understand how to use the product. Plan on running multiple iterations before you arrive at a satisfactory user experience.\n\n**PRODUCT CONCEPT TESTING**\n\nKnowing your product is feasible and usable is not enough. What\u2019s most important is to make sure people will actually buy it. For that, you need to get your product in front of real users and determine if it actually helps them accomplish their goals in a satisfying way. That\u2019s where product concept testing comes in.\n\nProduct concept testing can normally be combined with usability testing. To accomplish this goal, however, it\u2019s very important that the prototype be highly realistic. Fortunately, today\u2019s prototyping tools make this not only possible, but fast and easy as well.\n\n**FOLD IN YOUR FEEDBACK**\n\nAs you test your product concept, update your requirements based on the feedback you\u2019ve gained. The importance of this step cannot be overemphasized.

There are two reasons for this.\n\nThe first is time to market. Schedules often slip. When they do, you may need to trim features and requirements to meet your release date. You don\u2019t want your team implementing the easiest requirements first only to find that there\u2019s not enough time to complete all your must-haves.\n\nThe second reason is that requirements evolve. During implementation, you\u2019re likely to discover new needs. Some may be critically important and supersede existing requirements in terms of priority. You need to know where those new requirements fit in with your pecking order. If you don\u2019t, less important factors will determine what gets implemented first, which may have a negative impact on your product\u2019s success.\n\nBesides prioritizing requirements, you should also establish some quantifiable *metrics for success* that will establish the fitness of your product for release.

There can be many different solutions to the same problem. Some will be better than others. Incorrect assumptions may exclude the best of those solutions, closing doors to innovation.\n\nSecond, you risk frustrating the development team. Your engineers are paid to come up with a solution, which they then must implement and maintain. They\u2019re the folks who will have to live with it and support it.

Problems no one anticipated may rear their ugly heads late in the game when it\u2019s far more expensive to correct them.\n\nThe best safeguard against this is to have the team review drafts of the PRD early and often.

They can contain \u201cboiler plate\u201d text that is common across the product lines. In addition, it is common to have a common set of requirements that apply to many of the products developed by the organization such as quality requirements, safety and security requirements, user interface requirements for displays and controls, and requirements dealing with standards and regulations.\n\nStarting from a PRD template allows project team members to focus on defining requirements that are to be contained within the PRD rather than first having to invent an outline for organizing those needs and requirements. Once such templates have been developed, they can be reused for future projects. Having a standard organization for your requirements makes it easier to find information within the documents. The standard outline, boilerplate text, and requirements common to the product line can also be used as a checklist to prevent omissions.\n\nWhile you can use a PRD template for reuse across multiple projects, if this template lives in Word documents or spreadsheets, you\u2019ll still be working against version control issues and lengthy, confusing documents.

The PRD should communicate what, who, and how. What the purpose of the document and the product is, who it is for, and how it will result in the stakeholders\u2019 needs being met. Some organizations may refer to the PRD as a Product Requirement Specification (PRS), a Software Requirements Specification (SRS), a System Requirements Document (SRD), or System Design Specification (SDS).\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that the PRD is not the same as the Stakeholders Needs Document (SND). Ideally, the SND should come first, as it is focused on the customers\u2019, users\u2019, and other key stakeholders\u2019 needs and wants. Like the PRD, *some organizations may refer to the SND by various names: Marketing Requirements Document (MRD); Stakeholder Requirements Document (SRD), Business Requirements Document (BRD), Scope Definition Document (SDD), Product Concept Document (PCD), etc. The name is not as important as the contents.)*\n\nAny successful product development effort must begin with the customer and other key stakeholders\u2019 needs in mind. What problem is the product to address? What are the vision, goals, and objectives that define the expected outcomes? What are the drivers and constraints? Budget and schedule? What are the use cases and operational scenarios? What capabilities, features, performance, and level of quality do the stakeholders need? What are the safety and security risks associated with the use of the product that must be addressed? What standards and regulations apply? Is what is being asked for feasible?\n\nThese are some of the questions that must be addressed and documented within the SND at the beginning of the project. It is important to understand the stakeholder\u2019s perspective of what they need and expect from the product before defining the technical design input requirements. The integrated set of needs documented within the SND will be transformed into the requirements for inclusion in the PRD. The requirements in the PRD communicate to the development team what the product must do to meet the needs of customers, users, and other stakeholders.\n\nLearn more about defining and [managing requirements.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-management/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What are examples of good Agile requirements documents?", "level": 3, "content": "In general, the focus of Agile development results in Agile project teams avoiding documents as a formal method of communicating needs and requirements. Agile projects do address the information traditionally contained within SNDs (Stakeholders Need Document) and PRDs as described above, but in less formal forms relying on frequent interactions between team members and customers, progressing in \u201csprints.\u201d The team will define, informally, the expectations and desired outcomes for each sprint.\n\nHowever, many organizations will define a high-level set of project expectations, needs, and requirements in what some call an Agile Requirements Document (ARD). The information is high-level identifying the problem to be solved, the purpose, vision, goals, and objectives for the product, key drivers and constraints, high-level use cases, capabilities, features, performance expected, compliance requirements, etc.\n\nThe purpose of the ARD is to communicate a high-level definition for the Agile project team that bounds the scope of the project. The ARD is used to kick off the project, communicating high-level customer expectations which product acceptance will be based. At this level of communication, normally the contents of the ARD do not change once they are baselined and the project is initiated. The details for addressing the vision, goals, objectives, needs, and requirements within the ARD are left up to the Agile team.\n\nBecause of the nature of Agile product development, templates for SND and PRD type documents are not applicable. Agile teams must be flexible and respond quickly to changing requirements. For scrum teams, the short sprints and quick turnarounds mean there is little time to create documents, much less keep them updated and maintained.\n\nTeams working under Agile guidelines need to be able to remain nimble, which means avoiding the use of documents. In an agile environment, a team may have a short timeline for a sprint to complete a feature or new release. Adding the development of formal documents to this short process will only add an unnecessary layer of work and complication.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices Guide to Requirements & Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/guide-to-requirements-and-requirements-management)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "When are documents not the right call?", "level": 3, "content": "Historically, non-Agile product development projects define and record the data and information associated with the various product development artifacts in the form of \u201cdocuments\u201d like a SND or PRD as discussed above. However, using a document-centric approach has many disadvantages for today\u2019s products.\n\nAs products become more complex and regulated, the sheer volume of documentation can be overwhelming; especially in terms of configuration management, change control, and change impact assessment across the product lifecycle. Often, many of the documents are developed and managed by different, geographically separated organizational units in silos with limited collaboration.\n\nIn a document-centric approach, it is nearly impossible to keep all the data and information contained within the various documents synchronized, current, correct, and consistent. As a result, there is no real single source of truth (SSoT). For example, needs and requirements for the product may be undergoing change, making the maintenance of the data and information within the documents cumbersome and time-consuming. For highly regulated products, the amount of documentation that must be developed, maintained, and supplied to regulators to show compliance has become overwhelming. Inconsistencies in these documents can result in a product that is not approved for use.\n\nThe cost and time overhead associated with managing changes to the data and information within the documents consumes a large part of development cost, eating into profit margins. The time overhead often results in longer development times and time to market, making a company less competitive. Additionally, quality suffers resulting in post-product launch costs associated with increased returns for reimbursement, recalls, warranty work, and company image degradation associated with negative social media comments \u2014 all of which also eat into profits. A highly regulated product that is not approved for use can cause a company\u2019s stock price to plummet and, in some cases, push the company into bankruptcy.\n\nAs valuable as documents like the SND or PRD can be, managing the needs and requirements in document form has shortcomings like those discussed above. When change happens, the project team needs an effective method to assess how each change affects other artifacts across the lifecycle.\n\nTo effectively develop and manage these complex, highly regulated products, organizations need to transition to a requirements management software platform such as [Jama Connect](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/) allowing project teams to enable Live Traceability\u2122 in order to establish a SSoT, establish traceability across the product lifecycle, and manage and assess change.\n\nEven for less complex products, using documents as the primary form to record data and information typically contained within a PRD may not be the right call.

Defining requirements upfront allows you to effectively manage client expectations and create an implementation process that is smooth and seamless.\n\nA project that lacks this upfront clarity, however, can lead to a vaguely defined project scope and results that miss the mark. A study by the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute found that 60 percent to 80 percent of the cost of software development is in the rework. Furthermore, successful requirements management can eliminate 50 percent to 80 percent of project defects.\n\nSo, how can you ensure that your requirements are more accurately and clearly defined? It starts with understanding the key differences between functional and non-functional requirements and understanding the role that each plays in the success of your project.\n\nFunctional requirements focus on what the project should do, and non-functional requirements focus on how it should be. Let\u2019s break it down a little further.\n\n##### What are different uses cases of functional requirements and non-functional requirements?\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/diagram-1-functional-vs-non-functional.png)\n\n### What is a functional requirement?\n\n[Functional requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/functional-requirements/) focus on how the software must perform and specify the desired behavior of the system; for example, when specific conditions are met, the system will send a new user an email. Another example is that only employees on the management level can view salary data. More examples of functional requirements include those related to the following:\n\n- Audit tracking\n- Reporting requirements\n- Authorization levels\n- Legal or regulatory requirements\n- Business rules\n- Administrative functions\n- Certification requirements\n- Reporting requirements\n- External interfaces\n\n### What is a non-functional requirement?\n\n[Non-functional requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/non-functional-requirements/) are critical to the usability of a software system, and if you don\u2019t define them carefully, the end users\u2019 experience can be adversely affected. An example of non-functional requirements is defining how fast a website must load or specifying that a website must handle 10 million users without having any performance challenges. Non-functional requirements can also be related to security; for example, a user must change their initial login password upon logging in the first time. More examples include those related to:\n\n- Compliance\n- Documentation\n- Privacy\n- Portability\n- Quality\n- Reliability\n- Resilience\n- Response time\n- Scalability\n- Stability\n\nNon-functional requirements are focused on the system\u2019s operation rather than its behaviors; for example, data must be updated for users during access within three seconds. Non-functional requirements can also be defined by metrics and relate to aspects of the system that evolve over time, such as manageability or documentation.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

The non-functional requirement might dictate how fast the site loads. A website that loads slowly can adversely affect the user experience, which is why non-functional requirements are critical.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [ 8 Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Writing Requirements ](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/8-dos-and-donts-for-writing-requirements/)\n\n### What are user stories and how do they help?\n\nWhen [considering requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/) and defining those requirements, you\u2019ll find it helpful to consider integrating user stories. A user story is basically the description of a software feature from the user\u2019s perspective. The story defines what you want the system to do and how that affects the overall experience. A basic formula might look like the following:\n\n- A < define user type > wants < specify the specific goal > so that\n\nAcceptance criteria should also be included with user stories, which are the conditions the product needs to address to be acceptable to the client. Create at least one acceptance criterion for each user story. A few examples may include:\n\n- A search field needs to be placed on the top bar of the website\n- A search is started once the user hits the \u201csubmit\u201d button\n- The display language is English\n- No more than 150 characters can be typed into the search box\n\nUser stories are helpful in the context of non-functional requirements, as they allow you to take a deeper dive into the user experience and see how to make that process smoother.\n\n### Why are metrics used more in nonfunctional vs. functional requirements?\n\n[Non-functional requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/non-functional-requirements/) help companies measure the success of a system, so they must be measurable. The metrics must be qualitative and quantitative. You might require, for example, that a system be able to handle expansion in the future. That\u2019s a qualitative goal, but let\u2019s take it a step further and make it quantitative as well. You might require that the system handle at least 30,000 users within the next three years.\n\nThe benefit of focusing on quantitative goals is that the goal is easily measured and you and the client can agree on what success looks like.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/graphic3-1030x513.png)\n\n### What are requirement specifications? What is a requirements specification document?\n\nA [software requirements specification](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/system-requirement-specifications/) document, also known as an SRS document, addresses what the software will do and expectations with regard to its performance. The document also highlights what the product needs in terms of user functionality. Most documents include an overarching purpose and define functional and non-functional requirements. A few sections that you may want to include in your SRS document include:\n\n- Include a brief overview of the system, along with any relevant background details and terms that need definition upfront.\n- Overall description. Include any assumptions made about the project, its business values, and the overarching project vision.\n- Specific requirements. Define specific attributes to be included in the system, functional requirements, and any relevant database requirements.\n\nIf you want to view an example of an SRS document, Michigan State University has one that can give you a starting point for creating your own document.\n\n### Tracking Requirements: Why Traditional Documents May Miss the Mark\n\nTraceability is critical to project success. Gartner highlights one of the [main reasons](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/four-best-practices-for-requirements-traceability/) why companies struggle to achieve the benefits of traceability:\n\n*\u201cThe most widely adopted tools for requirements continue to be general document software such as Microsoft Office or Google Docs (40% to 50% of the market) due to cost, availability, and familiarity. Yet these often lead to poorly managed requirements, thus eliminating and exceeding any cost benefit the tools themselves have. Requirements end up captured in a variety of documents and spreadsheets supplemented by post-it notes in unmanaged versions with no traceability or reuse. This creates a more costly user acceptance testing cycle, both in the time to execute as well as remediation of issues found late in the process, where they are far more costly to address.\u201d \u2013 Gartner Research*\n\nSoftware and hardware teams must work together and [collaborate](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/requirements-gathering/) throughout the development process to define market requirements, functional vs. non functional requirements, test cases, and other critical pieces of information. This becomes a challenge, however, when teams use different tools and terminology and work with different methodologies.\n\nThe answer is to connect data, conversations, and decisions in a [single system](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/) in the product development process. This gives you the ability to consult and collaborate with people about requirements within the system, capture decisions and actions, and keep that information associated with the requirement. Down the road, if you need to revisit decisions, all data is stored and easy to find.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/write-better-requirements-with-jama-connect-advisor)\n\n### Moving Forward with Functional vs. Nonfunctional Requirements\n\nEvery software project has a vision, a goal, and a destination that you want to reach. Functional and non-functional requirements help you to [reach that goal more easily](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/requirements-analysis/) by setting clear boundaries. These requirements help you answer the most critical questions and ensure that products are developed with success in mind.\n\nFunctional requirements vs. non-functional requirements are critically important, but since non-functional goals are focused heavily on the user experience, these are arguably more critical. Understanding the role of each category empowers you to [define and track](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/agile-requirements-management/) each with greater success and create a road map that delivers on your client\u2019s expectations.\n\n### What\u2019s the Difference Between Functional Requirements and Non-Functional Requirements?\n\nDEFINITION OF A NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT\n\n**Non-Functional Requirements ** are a requirement that does not relate to functionality, but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability and portability.\n\nPREVIOUSHow to Write an Effective Product Requirements Document (PRD)\n\nNEXT UPWhat Are Nonfunctional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

As you shop, you have a couple of non-negotiable features or attributes in mind, such as saving destinations within the car\u2019s built-in GPS navigation system or that the car must be black. Although you may consider these to be \u201cmust-have\u201d features, they would be considered non-functional requirements tied to the user experience.\n\n### What are Nonfunction Requirements (NFR)?\n\nNon-functional requirements are global constraints on a software system e.g., development costs, operational costs, performance, reliability, maintainability, portability, robustness etc.\n\nA requirement that does not relate to functionality, but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability, and portability.\n\nIn systems engineering and requirements engineering, a non-functional requirement is a requirement that specifies criteria that can be used to judge the operation of a system, rather than specific behaviors.\n\nNon-functional requirements may be found in adverbs or modifying clauses, such as \u201cThe system prints invoices quickly\u201d or \u201cThe system prints invoices *with confidentiality.\u201d\n\nSoftware has\u00a0[non-functional requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-software/)\u00a0that are essential to creating a positive experience for the user. And if you miss the mark on these requirements, you may have scheduling delays, budget setbacks and unsatisfied clients.\n\nA project that lacks non-functional requirements may also lack clarity, which can result in vague project scope and a disconnect between the designer and client expectations.\n\nNon-functional requirements bridge the gap between what developers believe customers want and what customers really want.\n\nOne study found that\u00a0[60 to 80 percent](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/successful-requirements-management-can-eliminate-up-to-80-percent-of-project-defects/)\u00a0of the cost of software development involves rework. And when the non-functional requirements are done well, you may eliminate\u00a0[50 to 80 percent](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0of product defects.\n\nSo, now that we\u2019ve defined non-functional requirements, how do you integrate them effectively into your product development process?\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Axendia Report: The Costly Impact of Ineffective Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/axendia-report-the-costly-impact-of-ineffective-requirements-management-2)\n\n### Nonfunctional requirements focus on the\u201cilities\u201dof the product\n\nThe \u201cilities\u201d of a product include quality, reliability, manufacturability, usability, serviceability, upgradeability, etc. See\u00a0[SEAri MIT](http://seari.mit.edu/short_courses.php)\u00a0for more information.\n\nNon-functional requirements focus on the user experience. A non-functional requirement is a statement defining a system quality, constraint, or external interface. For example, you might want to build a system that can manage expansion in the future. But saying so isn\u2019t enough. You need to be specific. Instead, you might define that as \u201cbuilding a system that can manage at least 50,000 users over the next 24 months, so customers don\u2019t experience the frustration of system crashes.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, a non-functional requirement may:\n\n- Follow any legal or adherence rules.\n- Define quality attributes of the software.\n- Ensure performance in key areas such as reliability, availability, scalability, and more.\n- Focus on the user experience so the system is easy to operate and the risk for potential rework is minimized.\n\nJust as with car shopping, not everyone needs the same features to make their user experience great. You might want warming seats in a new car, but somebody else might want a third row of seats. So, the non-functional requirements that you define for your project will vary based on client expectations. A list of potential categories, however, can give you a starting point to consider which non-functional requirements need to be on your list.\n\nTo Learn More About How the FDA Defines Software Requirements Specification, Visit: [Guidance for the Content of Pre-market Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/files/medical%20devices/published/Guidance-for-the-Content-of-Premarket-Submissions-for-Software-Contained-in-Medical-Devices---Guidance-for-Industry-and-FDA-Staff.pdf)\n\n### What are the different types of nonfunctional requirements?\n\nThink about non-functional requirements as buckets that hold attributes important to the user experience. Remember, it\u2019s not what a product will do (which are its\u00a0[functional requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development/)), but it\u2019s what a project will be.\n\nIf you have selected the right buckets and measured the right things, then you can feel confident that you\u2019re handing over a product that will meet customer expectations \u2013 because you\u2019ve clearly defined these expectations up front. Everyone is on the same page, which is even further enhanced when you\u00a0[centralize your requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/), which we\u2019ll touch on shortly.\n\nFor now, let\u2019s look at some of the potential categories for non-functional requirements:\n\n- **Performance and scalability.**\u00a0What are the required response times, benchmark specifications, and other attributes related to performance? How fast does the system provide results, and how will the performance change with higher workloads?\n- **Operating constraints.**\u00a0Operating constraints may include any required software requirements, system requirements, and run-time constraints that need to be considered in product development.\n- **Platform constraints.**\u00a0Most projects include some sort of platform constraints. Clearly define these upfront.\n- **Modifiability.**\u00a0How much effort is required to make changes to the software? Defining this upfront can help the customer better plan for any potential changes.\n- **Portability requirements and capability.**\u00a0How difficult will it be to move the software to a different platform? What hardware and operating system does the software run on? Does it conflict with other processes or applications within these environments? Clearly define these elements.\n- **Reliability.**\u00a0How often does the software fail? Outline any consequence of software failure and strategies for detecting errors, plans for error correction, and more.\n- **Security.**\u00a0Security focuses on the requirements for protecting the system and data. How much time and effort does it take to break into the system, and how can you mitigate these exposures?\n- **Usability.**\u00a0Usability is focused on the user experience. How difficult is it to learn and operate the system, and how can you improve any potential uses?\n- **Legal.**\u00a0There may be legal issues around data privacy, intellectual property rights and more.\n\nCategories vary by project, yet some common categories include availability, capacity, reliability and security. Using a few of the more common ones to start and then expanding to other areas can help you build a template for new product development projects.\n\n### Functional vs. nonfunctional requirements: What\u2019s the difference?\n\n#### Attributes of Functions vs Nonfunctional Requirements\n\n**Functional requirements\u00a0are**\u00a0focused on how the software needs to perform or the desired behavior of the system. For example, if a specific condition is met, a system will send a new user a welcome email. A functional requirement is focused on what the system does when a requirement is met. Other functional requirements might involve business rules, reporting requirements, audit tracking, and more.\n\nA\u00a0**non-functional requirement**\u00a0focuses on properties and characteristics of the product that are generally passive. Non-functional requirements are focused on attributes such as privacy, portability, reliability, stability, and more.\n\n### What is a nonfunctional requirements document?\n\nNon-functional requirements are one component of the software requirements specification document (SRS document). This document focuses on what the software is expected to do and how it\u2019s expected to perform. It also addresses what is required in terms of functionality from a user perspective.\n\nThe SRS documents include a few sections, such as:\n\n- **Overview of the system.**\u00a0The overview includes high-level details about the system. Any useful terms are defined upfront in a glossary-like format.\n- **General description.**\u00a0This section outlines any assumptions about the project and the overarching vision or theme.\n- **Specific requirements.**\u00a0This section is where the functional and non-functional requirements are included.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t written an SRS document before, or if you want to improve on your existing document, check out\u00a0[examples](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~cse435/Handouts/SRSExample-webapp.doc)\u00a0as a starting point. These also provide inspiration for how non-functional requirements examples flow into the entire document.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-and-traceability-solution)\n\n### What templates exist for tracking and managing a nonfunctional requirement?\n\nSoftware and hardware teams collaborate throughout the entire development process as they define functional and non-functional requirements. However, this collaboration becomes problematic when teams use different tools. Centralizing requirements management allows you to save time, align more effectively, and ensure the quality and compliance of product development. Using a single solution enables you to effectively:\n\n- **Experience a single source of truth.**\u00a0A single source of truth offers greater visibility throughout the entire product development cycle.\n- **Benefit from real-time iteration.**\u00a0Working within a requirements management platform that has visibility and communication across all development teams enables more informed decisions and improves collaboration abilities.\n- **Enjoy stronger visualization.**\u00a0You can more effectively visualize how tests trackback to requirements, resulting in higher quality and compliance.\n- **Reuse validation requirements.**\u00a0Reuse validated requirements to quickly replicate features across products.\n\nCentralizing requirements management allows you to build stronger and more effective non-functional requirements, which improves product development. A single source of truth empowers you to connect data, conversations, and decisions \u2013 all within a single system.\n\nThe result is that you can collaborate and communicate critical pieces of information around product development, resulting in less rework, fewer missed deadlines and happier clients.\n\n### In This Video, Learn How To Excel in Requirements Management for Successful Software Delivery and Implementation\n\nDEFINITION OF A NONFUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENT\n\nA** Nonfunctional Requirement** is a requirement that does not relate to functionality, but to attributes such as reliability, efficiency, usability, maintainability and portability.\n\nPREVIOUSFunctional vs. Non-Functional Requirements\n\nNEXT UPCharacteristics of Effective Software Requirements and Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

In this post, we\u2019ll start by discussing several different characteristics that individual requirements should exhibit. Then, we\u2019ll then look at the desirable traits a successful SRS should have as a whole.\n\n### Characteristics of Effective Requirements\n\nIn an ideal world, every individual user requirement, business requirement, and functional requirement would exhibit the qualities described in the following sections.\n\n#### Complete\n\nEach requirement must fully describe the functionality to be delivered. It must contain all the information necessary for the developer to design and implement that bit of functionality. If you know you\u2019re lacking certain information, use TBD (to be determined) as a standard flag to highlight these gaps. Resolve all TBDs in each portion of the requirements before you proceed with construction of that portion.\n\nNothing says you need to make the entire requirements set complete before construction begins. In most cases, you\u2019ll never achieve that goal. However, projects using iterative or incremental development life cycles should have a complete set of requirements for each iteration.\n\nUsing minimal requirements specifications runs the risk of having different people fill in the blanks in different ways, based on different assumptions and decisions. Keep requirements details verbal instead of written also makes it hard for business analysts, developers, and testers to share a common understanding of the requirements set.\n\n#### Correct\n\nEach requirement must accurately describe the functionality to be built.\n\nThe reference for correctness is the source of the requirement, such as an actual user or a high-level system requirement. A software requirement that conflicts with its parent system requirement is not correct.\n\nOnly user representatives can determine the correctness of user requirements (such as use cases), which is why users or their close surrogates must review the requirements.\n\n#### Feasible\n\nIt must be possible to implement each requirement within the known capabilities and limitations of the system and its operating environment. To avoid specifying unattainable requirements, have a developer work with marketing or the BA throughout the elicitation process.\n\nThe developer can provide a reality check on what can and cannot be done technically and what can be done only at excessive cost. Incremental development approaches and proof-of-concept prototypes are ways to evaluate requirement feasibility.\n\n#### Necessary\n\nEach requirement should document a capability that the stakeholders really need or one that\u2019s required for conformance to an external system requirement or a standard.\n\nEvery requirement should originate from a source that has the authority to specify requirements. Trace each requirement back to specific voice-of-the-customer input, such as a use case, a business rule, or some other origin of value.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [8 Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Writing Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/8-dos-and-donts-for-writing-requirements/)\n\n#### Prioritized\n\nAssign an implementation priority to each functional requirement, feature, use case, or user story to indicate how essential it is to a particular product release.\n\nIf all the requirements are considered equally important, it\u2019s hard for the project manager to respond to budget cuts, schedule overruns, personnel losses, or new requirements added during development. Prioritization is an essential key to successful iterative development.\n\n#### Unambiguous\n\nAll readers of a requirement statement should arrive at a single, consistent interpretation of it, but natural language is highly prone to ambiguity. Write requirements in simple, concise, straightforward language appropriate to the user domain. \u201cComprehensible\u201d is a requirement quality goal related to \u201cunambiguous\u201d: readers must be able to understand what each requirement is saying. Define all specialized terms and those that might confuse readers in a glossary.\n\nA good way to help ensure requirements are written in concise, unambiguous language is to use requirements templates like the [EARS models](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/writing-requirements/functional-requirements-examples-and-templates).\n\n#### Verifiable\n\nSee whether you can devise a few tests or use other verification approaches, such as inspection or demonstration, to determine whether the product properly implements each requirement.\n\nIf a requirement isn\u2019t verifiable, determining whether it was correctly implemented becomes a matter of opinion, not objective analysis. Requirements that are incomplete, inconsistent, infeasible, or ambiguous are also unverifiable.\n\n### Characteristics of Effective Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)\n\nIt\u2019s not enough to have excellent individual requirement statements. Sets of requirements that are collected into a software requirements specification (SRS) ought to exhibit the characteristics described in the following sections.\n\n#### Complete\n\nNo requirements or necessary information should be absent. Missing requirements are hard to spot because they aren\u2019t there! Focusing on user tasks, rather than on system functions, can help you to prevent incompleteness. \u201cI don\u2019t know of any way to be absolutely certain that you haven\u2019t missed a requirement,\u201d says Karl Weigers, author of *Software Requirements, Third Edition.* \u201cThere\u2019s a chapter of my book that offers some suggestions about how to see if you\u2019ve overlooked something important.\u201d\n\n#### Consistent\n\nConsistent software requirements don\u2019t conflict with other requirements of the same type or with higher-level business, system, or user requirements. Disagreements between requirements must be resolved before development can proceed. If you spot a pair of conflicting requirements, you might not know which one (if either) is correct until you do some research. Recording the originator of each requirement lets you know who to talk to if you discover conflicts in your software requirements specification.\n\n#### Modifiable\n\nYou must be able to revise the SRS when necessary and maintain a history of changes made to each requirement. This dictates that each requirement be uniquely labeled and expressed separately from other requirements so that you can refer to it unambiguously.\n\nEach requirement should appear only once in the SRS. It\u2019s easy to generate inconsistencies by changing only one instance of a duplicated requirement. Consider cross-referencing subsequent instances back to the original statement instead of duplicating the requirement. A table of contents and an index will make the SRS easier to modify. Storing requirements in a database or a commercial\u00a0[requirements management solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0makes them into reusable objects.\n\n#### Traceable\n\nA\u00a0[traceable requirement](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/features/) can be linked backwards to its origin and forward to the design elements and source code that implement it and to the test cases that verify the implementation as correct. Traceable requirements are uniquely labeled with persistent unique identifiers. They are written in a structured, fine-grained way as opposed to crafting long narrative paragraphs. Avoid lumping multiple requirements together into a single statement; the individual requirements might trace to different design and code elements.\n\nREAD MORE: [[Answered] The Most Asked Questions About Writing Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/answered-the-most-asked-questions-about-writing-requirements/)\n\n### Best Practices for Writing Exceptional Requirements\n\n#### 1.Engage Stakeholders Early and Often\n\nEngaging stakeholders early in the requirements gathering process ensures that their expectations are not just met but anticipated. Conduct interviews, workshops, and surveys to collect comprehensive feedback. Continuous involvement leads to more accurate, complete, and reliable requirements while helping to avoid costly revisions downstream.\n\n#### 2.Implement Standardized Language\n\nAmbiguity in language can lead to misinterpretations. To minimize confusion, use standardized, domain-specific terminology when crafting requirements. Maintain a glossary of key terms so all team members, from developers to external stakeholders, are aligned in their understanding.\n\n#### 3.Adopt Visual Aids for Complex Requirements\n\nWhen requirements become intricate, visual representations like workflows, wireframes, or block diagrams can provide clarity. Tools such as Unified Modeling Language (UML) or simple process maps are especially effective in visualizing software behavior and interactions, making requirements easier to understand and implement.\n\n#### 4.Leverage Collaborative Tools\n\nModern requirements management solutions offer collaborative features to streamline communication and traceability. Tools like Jama Connect, Jira, or IBM DOORS make it easier to track changes, document approvals, and ensure all stakeholders are aware of updates in real time.\n\n#### 5.Validate Requirements Iteratively\n\nRather than waiting until a requirements document is complete, validate individual requirements iteratively. Bring in diverse stakeholders to catch inconsistencies, infeasibilities, or redundant requirements early in the process. A quick feedback loop ensures that you\u2019re always producing actionable and relevant specifications.\n\n#### 6.Prioritize User Experience\n\nRequirements should reflect the end-user\u2019s experience and needs. Use prototypes or mock-ups to contextualize requirements. User-focused design principles ensure that the functional requirements align with the user\u2019s expectations and goals.\n\n### The Role of Continuous Improvement in Requirements Engineering\n\nCreating excellent requirements and SRS is rarely a one-time effort. Continuous improvement through post-project evaluations, lessons learned, and incorporating the latest methodologies strengthens the quality of future requirements. Actively monitoring industry-wide advancements or frameworks, such as adopting EARS notation for simplified requirements writing, keeps teams at the forefront of requirements best practices.\n\nUpdating your processes and tools regularly not only keeps your requirements high-quality but also helps adapt to changing industry standards, market expectations, and technological advancements.\n\nREAD MORE: [[Answered] The Most Asked Questions About Writing Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/answered-the-most-asked-questions-about-writing-requirements/)\n\n### How Do You Know If Your Requirements and SRS Exhibit These Attributes?\n\nThe best way to tell whether your requirements have these desired attributes is to have several project stakeholders carefully review the SRS. Different stakeholders will spot different kinds of problems. For example, analysts and developers can\u2019t accurately judge completeness or correctness, whereas users can\u2019t assess technical feasibility.\n\nYou\u2019ll never create an SRS in which all requirements demonstrate all these ideal attributes. However, if you keep these characteristics in mind while you write and review the requirements, you will produce better requirements documents and you will build better products.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss the Benefits of Modern Requirements Management\n\nDEFINITION OF A SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION:\n\n**A Software Requirements Definitions (SRS) ** is a description of a software system to be developed. It is modeled after business requirements specification (CONOPS). The software requirements specification lays out functional and non-functional requirements, and it may include a set of use cases that describe user interactions that the software must provide to the user for perfect interaction.\n\nPREVIOUSWhat Are Nonfunctional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?\n\nNEXT UP8 Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for Writing Requirements\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

Something as simple as adding an adverb or using \u201cshould\u201d instead of \u201cmust\u201d can create ambiguity that confuses engineers and sets a project back.\n\nBetter requirements lead to clearer, more effective communication between stakeholders. This drives the entire organization toward greater transparency, less rework, and, accelerated development\u2026 without sacrificing quality. While writing requirements is both an art and a science that will vary by context, there are a few best practices to consider.\n\nFollow these top dos and don\u2019ts for writing requirements and you\u2019ll find yourself with both clear and traceable requirements across the product development lifecycle.\n\n### 1. DO: Use a Requirements Template\n\nA template gives consistent structure to requirements. It can be in a user story or systems engineering format, either of which provides uniform construction to support easier testing.\n\n### 2. DON\u2019T: Use Adverbs\n\n\u201cQuickly,\u201d \u201ceasily,\u201d and other adverbs don\u2019t provide clear guidance to testers. Instead, focus on acceptance criteria that are testable and measurable.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices Guide for Writing Requirements](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/best-practices-guide-for-writing-requirements)\n\n### 3. DO: Standardize Your Language\n\nThe English language contains numerous words with similar meanings in everyday usage. Settle on a few to represent agreed-upon meanings, like \u201cshall\u201d for binding high-priority requirements.\n\n### 4. DON\u2019T: Be Ambiguous\n\nRequirements are often ambiguous because they\u2019re too general, e.g., \u201cthe device shall be easy to use.\u201d Get more specific, whether that means setting a clear benchmark or naming a specific color.\n\n### 5. DO: Use Active Voice and Specific Adjectives\n\nUse active voice verbs. For instance, \u201cthe car shall withstand\u2026\u201d is clearer than \u201cthe car shall be enhanced to withstand\u2026\u201d Also select specific adjectives instead of standbys like \u201cuser-friendly\u201d and \u201ccompatible.\u201d\n\n### 6. DON\u2019T: Mix Design Specifications into Requirements\n\nWhen possible, aim to remove design from requirements, as the latter describe a need while the former constitute a response to that need. Design-free requirements give engineers more freedom.\n\n### 7. DO: Regularly Review Requirements with Stakeholders\n\nReviewing your requirements with others is a reliable way to ensure shared understanding. Collaborating within a real-time platform lets teams exchange feedback, ensure testability, and minimize rework.\n\n### 8. DON\u2019T: Rely on Negative Requirements Statements\n\nNegative statements can introduce ambiguity, since there are virtually infinite things that any system will \u201cnot do\u201d en route to fulfilling its positive requirements. Check negative statements\n\n### In This Webinar, We Cover Best Practices for Writing Requirements\n\nREAD MORE: [Best Practices Guide to Requirements & Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/guide-to-requirements-and-requirements-management)\n\nDEFINITION OF A REQUIREMENT:\n\n**Requirement:** a condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective.\n\nPREVIOUSCharacteristics of Effective Software Requirements and Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)\n\nNEXT UPRequirements Gathering and Management Processes\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

An Overview and Intro into Requirements Engineering\n\nRequirements management (RM) is a challenge for many companies, partly due to the ambiguity involved in software development. First, you must understand the client\u2019s requirements. Second, you must match those requirements to critical processes.\n\nRM is a component of requirements engineering (RE), which bridges the divide between a client\u2019s needs and what developers create. When done well, RE has the ability to create a solid framework for software development. This is critical since poor software engineering requirements management is a root of many project failures.\n\nA\u00a0[CIO magazine study](https://www.cio.com/article/2448110/fixing-the-software-requirements-mess.html#:~:text=Analysts%20report%20that%20as%20many,deadlines%20or%20change%20management%20fiascoes.)\u00a0found that \u201cAnalysts report that as many as 71% of software projects that fail do so because of poor requirements management, making it the single biggest reason for project failure.\u201d\n\nIn 1999, NASA built the $125 million Mars Climate Orbiter probe. The probe failed because it entered orbit 100 kilometers too close to Mars. The source of the error was a conflict between different requirements; eliminating such conflicts is an important component of RE.\n\nUnderstanding the details involved in requirements engineering and best practices can set you on the path to successfully meeting client expectations.\n\n### What is requirements engineering?\n\nClients have a long list of goals when creating new software, and RE provides a framework for meeting those goals. Important needs are inventoried and transformed into a detailed set of requirements. Requirements development dictates future development activities and creates a blueprint for success.\n\nThe terms \u201crequirements management\u201d and \u201crequirements engineering\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they are different. RM is one piece of requirements engineering, and getting it right makes all the difference.\n\nRE ensures that the problem a client wants solved is clearly defined and the solution is both accurate and effective. Essentially, RE transforms a real-world problem into a highly functional software solution.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are Functional Requirements and How Do They Impact Product Development?\n](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-are-functional-requirements-and-how-do-they-impact-product-development/)\n\n### The 4 steps of the requirements engineering process\n\n![Image showing a bar graph which represents a team of people taking the 4 steps of the requirements engineering process.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/RISK-1030x1030.png)\n\nThe requirements engineering process has many potential pitfalls. Strengthening your RE process enables you to avoid many common challenges. The process serves as a compass, guiding you in determining the exact deliverables and doing so with greater accuracy. All important parties are on the same page about what steps need to be taken to achieve the desired outcome. Strengthen your RE process by considering the following:\n\n**Elicit requirements****.**\u00a0Elicitation is about becoming familiar with all the important details involved with the project. The customer will provide details about their needs and furnish critical background information. You will study those details and also become familiar with similar types of software solutions. This step provides important context for development.\n\n**Requirements specification.**\u00a0During the specification phase, you gather\u00a0[functional and nonfunctional project requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-functional-requirement-vs-non-functional-requirements/). A variety of tools are used during this stage, including data flow diagrams, to add more clarity to the project goals.\n\n**Verification and validation.** Verification ensures the software is built to the customer\u2019s requirements. In contrast, validation ensures the software is implementing the right functions. If the requirements don\u2019t go through the validation stage, there is the potential for time-consuming and expensive reworks.\n\n**Requirements management.** RM is an ongoing process that runs in parallel to the other three processes just described. In RM, you\u2019re matching all the relevant processes to their requirements. You will analyze, document, and prioritize the requirements \u2013 and communicate with relevant stakeholders. Any requirements that need modification are handled in an efficient and systematic manner.\n\nAs you implement the different components of RE, it also helps you get a sense of what should be excluded from requirements. Understanding this will help you focus more accurately on developing requirements and better meeting client expectations.\n\n#### What information should be excluded from the requirements?\n\nRequirements should be viewed as addressing a problem but not necessarily as providing a solution. A requirement should clearly state what you want to solve, not how you want to solve it. Let\u2019s take a look at guidelines for good requirements:\n\n- The requirement accurately defines the need of the stakeholder.\n- The requirement is testable.\n\nA requirement needs to be clear and understandable, without the risk of ambiguity. An important step in\u00a0[developing good requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-good-requirements-pt-i-of-iii/)\u00a0is the review process. Does the requirement accurately express the needs of the stakeholders? Make sure to build in enough client reviews so that you can get early feedback and adjust as needed.\n\n### Common mistakes to avoid\n\n![Image showing a person in front of their team with a warning sign, indicating there are common mistakes to avoid in their requirements engineering process.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/RISK-1-1030x1030.png)\n\nThere are many challenges that may occur as you develop your RE framework. Understanding potential issues can help you avoid them. Consider the following as you develop your processes:\n\n- **Avoid scope creep.**\u00a0There is a temptation to add \u201cjust one tiny new requirement\u201d to make the client happy. But these little changes add up and may have an impact on future activities, such as testing, documentation and more.\n- **Resist the urge to \u201cover-engineer.\u201d**\u00a0Over-engineering can be tempting, especially when you want to make sure everything is just right for the client. But this overzealousness can backfire. Adding a little extra code because \u201cI\u2019m doing this, I may as well do that\u201d might seem logical, these changes can create a ripple effect, putting requirements at risk in the future.\n- **Not building in enough feedback and reviews. **Early feedback is essential to a project\u2019s success. Build in frequent reviews and\u00a0[solid traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-good-requirements-pt-i-of-iii/)\u00a0to get feedback often and early.\n- **Failing to search thoroughly for all the important stakeholders. **You might think you\u2019ve included all the important stakeholders, only to learn you missed one later on. Invest time early in the process to find any and all important stakeholders in order to avoid expensive reworks later in the process.\n- **Failing to identify potential resistance early in the process. **Resistance can be an invisible but serious project problem. Learn to identify resistance early in the process so that you can work through it efficiently and early, getting everyone on the same page.\n\nAwareness of these potential pitfalls can save you time, money and resources during the RE process. Also, look at your existing processes and whether they include enough traceability. Ensuring that deliverables meet requirements, for example, is much easier if every requirement is linked to at least one test. Traceability is an essential part of this process.\n\nEngineers can then invest their energy into requirements that are failing the test and get the project back on track quickly.\n\n### Leveraging the right tools for success\n\n![Image showing a team who leveraged the right tools for success in their requirements engineering process.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/RISK-2-1030x1030.png)\n\nRequirements engineering is critical to the success of a project because it tells everyone involved with the project what needs to be done. The more accurate the requirements, the easier it is for the project manager to schedule development tasks, for example. A requirements management software tool can greatly support successful RE, as it enables more efficient and optimized product and system development.\n\nThis type of tool can provide:\n\n- **Clarity and visibility.** Gain broader visibility into what you\u2019re building and why.\n- **Live traceability.**\u00a0Ensure product quality and improve change management with complete traceability.\n- **Decision tracking and fast reviews.**\u00a0Conduct virtual reviews of requirements, test cases, user needs and more.\n- **Real-time collaboration.**\u00a0Immediately note and prioritize important decisions, pull in the required stakeholders and reference historical context to eliminate communication errors.\n\nThe right tool can help you transform RM as you easily track, review, sign-off and truly understand how and why you did certain things. As a result, you can streamline your product development process and increase efficiency, understand and respond to change, and establish a higher level of clarity and visibility.\n\nSee how Jama Connect can help with requirements engineering by downloading our\u00a0[solution overview](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices Guide to Requirements & Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/guide-to-requirements-and-requirements-management)\n\n### Learn More About the Impact of Poor Requirements Management\n\nDEFINITION OF A REQUIREMENTS ENGINEERING:\n\n**Requirements Engineering** ensures that the problem a client wants solved is clearly defined and the solution is both accurate and effective.

The purpose of requirements analysis is to be sure all product requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs and requirements. When executed correctly, requirements analysis results in a set of product requirements that, when met, will result in a deliverable that matches stakeholder expectations.\n\n### What is requirements analysis?\n\nThe requirements analysis is the process of discovering stakeholder needs and requirements for a system or software application being developed. It confirms accurate capture, interpretation, and representation of the customers\u2019, users\u2019, and other stakeholders\u2019 needs and transforms those needs into a set of requirements for a product. For optimal results, the set of product requirements must be verified to have the characteristics of well-formed requirements (e.g. needed, unambiguous, complete, consistent, correct, feasible, verifiable) and validated that they represent the intent of the needs from which they were transformed.\n\n### Best practices for requirements analysis\n\nStakeholders can communicate their expectations in several forms \u2013 needs and requirements. Stakeholder needs represent what the stakeholders need the product to do to address the problem or opportunity the product is to address; stakeholder requirements are top-level, stakeholder-defined product requirements that communicate what the stakeholders require of the product to meet their needs.\u00a0 Stakeholder needs are expressed in natural language without the use of \u201cshall\u201d, while stakeholder requirements are communicated with \u201cshall\u201d to make sure they are treated as binding requirements the product will be verified to meet.\n\nIt is important to define and understand the stakeholder needs and requirements before defining the product requirements to which the product will be designed and built. Since there are multiple stakeholders, there will be multiple sets of stakeholder needs and requirements.\u00a0 It is up to the project team to elicit these needs and requirements and to resolve conflicts, inconsistencies, and other issues.\u00a0 The results will be an integrated set of needs from which the product requirements will be transformed.\u00a0 The resulting product requirements represent what the product must do in order for the needs to meet the stated needs.\n\n[Requirements traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/) is of the utmost importance to the requirements analysis process. It is used to ensure that each requirement clearly communicates the intent of its source. Without traceability, it\u2019s nearly impossible to know if the software product meets its stakeholders\u2019 needs, goals and constraints. Requirements analysis could be executed perfectly, but without traceability of requirements to their source, there would be no way to prove you have the full, correct set of requirements.\n\nTherefore, a best practice of requirements analysis is to ensure that each requirement is traceable to all corresponding artifacts. These artifacts include not only their source but also downstream artifacts including the design, product verification planning and product validation planning.\n\nAnother equally important best practice for requirements analysis is to execute a predetermined process. Carefully performing each step can be the difference between a product\u2019s success or failure meeting stakeholder needs.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Perform Better Impact Analysis on Upstream and Downstream Relationships](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/better-impact-analysis-on-upstream-and-downstream-relationships/?utm_campaign=cta+blog)\n\n### The requirements analysis process\n\nGenerally, there are seven steps in the requirements analysis process.\n\n1. *Identify stakeholders.* The first step is to pinpoint exactly who the key stakeholders are for the project. This includes internal and external customers, users, regulatory agencies, and stakeholder involved in the development of the product. It is the stakeholders who are the source of the needs and requirements the product must fulfill.\n2. *Elicit stakeholder needs and requirements.* During this step of the requirements analysis process \u2014 also called needs and\u00a0[requirements gathering\u00a0](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-gathering)\u2014 teams work with the stakeholders to identify the latter\u2019s needs and requirements.\n3. *Model needs and requirements. W*ith the initial sets of stakeholder needs and requirements captured, teams can create visual representations or diagrams of the needs and requirements as part of their analysis to inform the definition of the product requirements, use cases, and user stories. These visual representations and diagrams are used to solicit feedback from stakeholders and to resolve issues, conflicts, and inconsistencies before defining and baselining the product requirements.\n4. *Retrospective.* The project team reviews the data and information gathered during elicitation, diagraming, and modeling. Of particular interest is understanding the drivers and constraints to better understand the feasibility and risks associated with developing the product, to assess whether anything has been missed, and to establish a budget and schedule.\n5. *Define an integrated set of needs.* The project team derives an integrated set of stakeholder needs and requirements that represent the stakeholders\u2019 expectations, goals, objectives, drivers, and constraints for the product.\n6. *Define product requirements. *\u00a0At this point, teams review the resulting integrated set of needs and stakeholder requirements and transforms them into a set of requirements for the product to which the product will be designed and built. It is important that the resulting requirements are [high-quality requirements](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/the-bottom-line-better-requirements-add-business-value)\u00a0having the characteristics of well-formed requirements. It\u2019s wise to make sure that all team members know\u00a0[how to write good requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/answered-the-most-asked-questions-about-writing-requirements/).\n7. *Sign-off and baseline.* The final step of the requirements analysis process is to get sign-off agreement from all key stakeholders (or representatives from stakeholder groups) identified in step one for the integrated set of needs and resulting set of product requirements. This is a formal contract that lets everyone know what the product will be verified and validated against, the cost, and the schedule. It helps eliminate surprises and scope creep later in the development process.\n\n### Common challenges during requirements analysis\n\nThe steps above will likely need repeating, as the most common challenge of requirements analysis is that requirements may change throughout the software development process. As the team implements various features, these steps should be repeated for each feature; doing so will often result in additional needs and requirements. The risk of change can be reduced by following the prescribed steps and getting sign off at the beginning of the project for not only the integrated product but for each feature to be provided by the software application.\n\nOne reason for change is a failure to include all relevant stakeholders. If the focus is just on the customers or users, needs and requirements associated with other stakeholders will be missed. Given the large number of different stakeholders, there will be inconsistencies, conflicts, and issues. Failure to deal with these early, will result in change. The use of various visualizations, diagrams, and models before baselining the integrated set of needs and product requirements helps ensure completeness, correctness, and consistency. Again, failing to do this before baselining the set of product requirements will result in change and lead to costly and time-consuming rework.\n\nIn other situations, it may be that some stakeholders won\u2019t know exactly what they need until they see the product in action. Project constraints may also necessitate changes in the solution. In any case, agile teams are constantly iterating and updating design. This means the process of evaluating needs and requirements almost never ends. The diagraming and modeling step above is a great tool that can be used to interact with stakeholders to better understand their needs. The goal is to be as comprehensive as possible the first time through and get a big-picture view to minimize scrap and rework.\n\n### The pros and cons of various diagraming and modeling techniques\n\nA variety of techniques are available during elicitation, diagraming, and modeling. Some are more beneficial than others. Here we review some popular techniques and point out the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n\n#### Flowcharts\n\nFlowcharts show the sequential flow and control logic of a set of related activities. They can be used to represent data flows, system (software application) interactions \u2013 both internally and externally \u2013 and more.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- Multiple formats: linear, cross-functional, top-down.\n- Easy to create and understand for all team members.\n- Highlights critical process attributes.\n\n**CON**\n\n- Change management is time consuming, as flowcharts need to be redrawn to accommodate process alterations.\n- Complex processes result in dense flowcharts that can be difficult to understand.\n\n#### Data flow diagrams\n\nThese show the flow of information through a system. Data flow diagram components include the process, flow, store, and terminator.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- Can be created in the requirement elicitation step of the analysis process to define a project\u2019s scope.\n- They can be understood by technical and non-technical audiences.\n\n**CON**\n\n- They can be time-consuming to create, particularly for complex software applications.\n- Physical considerations are not included in a data flow diagram.\n\n#### Role activity diagrams\n\nRole-activity diagrams show business and software processes as a progression of actions conducted by role. Roles are identified by activities and grouped into responsibilities. They can be used for describing use cases, workflows, business processes, or software protocols.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- Illustrate the individual steps in activities, as well as the order in which they are to be performed.\n- Supports communication across roles.\n\n**CON**\n\n- Each workflow requires a new diagram else they become too unwieldy. This makes it difficult to get a full view of the system.\n- These diagrams do not provide detail on how objects behave or collaborate.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [G2 Grid Report for Requirements Management Software \u2013 Summer 2021](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/g2-grid-report-for-requirements-management-software-summer-2021)\n\n#### Unified Modeling Language (UML)\n\nUnified Modeling Language creates diagrams used for modeling specification, development, visualization, and documenting in the requirements analysis process. UML diagrams can be two types of models: a behavioral model, which informs on what the software application will do, and a structural model, which provides insight on the parts that make up the system.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- There are a variety of UML diagrams to choose from, like use case, sequence, interaction, class, and more.\n- Can be directly inputted to a requirements tool.\n\n**CON**\n\n- UML diagrams must be synchronized with software code, which requires additional work and ongoing maintenance.\n- Complex processes result in overcomplicated and confusing diagrams.\n\n#### Business process modeling and notation (BPMN)\n\nBPMN is based on a flowchart technique like activity diagrams from Unified Modeling Language (UML). It uses a unique standard of notation to create graphs including flow objects, connecting objects, swim lanes, and artifacts. These help simplify understanding of the business process answering questions regarding who performs the activities and the data elements required to do so.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- Designed to be understood by all business stakeholders yet represent complex process semantics.\n- Supported by most modeling tools.\n\n**CON**\n\n- Only supports concepts of modeling applicable to business processes; non-process purposes are out of scope.\n\n#### Gantt Charts\n\nIn requirements analysis, Gantt charts help with coordinating, planning, and tracking project tasks. Tasks to be performed are listed along the vertical axis. The horizontal axis lists the time allotted for the given task and the person or team performing the functions. Gantt charts give a visual representation of the project\u2019s schedule and resources needed.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- A single chart can track many activities, even those happening in parallel.\n- It provides a realistic view of how long the project will take and what resources are needed at various points in development.\n\n**CON**\n\n- A single view of all the tasks is not available.\n- Time allotted for a task is not representative of the amount of work involved in its completion.\n- Complex software projects require an extremely high number of tasks, making a Gantt chart exorbitantly time-consuming to create and nearly impossible to update in a timely, consistent fashion.\n\n#### Integrated definition for function modeling (IDEF) diagrams\n\nIDEF is a family of\u00a0modeling languages that cover a wide range of uses, from functional modeling to data, simulation, object-oriented analysis/design, and knowledge acquisition.[[i]](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/a-guide-to-requirements-analysis-for-product-teams/#_edn1)\u00a0The goal is to gain an understanding of an organization\u2019s systems by exploring process function relationships to child/parent systems.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- IDEF can be used in almost any context, industry, and technology area.\n- Diagrams are easy to digest for both technical and nontechnical team members.\n\n**CON**\n\n- It can be difficult to integrate different IDEF techniques.\n- Designed as a business analysis tool, it is not a very good software application development methodology.\n\n#### Gap analysis\n\nAlso known as need analysis, need assessment, or need-gap analysis, this technique helps analyze software application performance gaps to verify if business requirements are successfully met. Gap analysis conveys the difference between the current state and the target state, identifying where the project stands and what is yet to be done.\n\n**PRO**\n\n- Ensures the business requirements or data requirements have been met as desired.\n- Helps uncover which areas need focus or additional resources.\n\n**CON**\n\n- Success depends on the skills of those performing the analysis, and while gaps may be revealed, their true causes may remain undiscovered.\n\n#### Focus of the various diagraming and modeling techniques\n\nSome requirements diagraming and modeling techniques are better for analyzing business needs and requirements while others are better suited for discovering user needs and requirements.\n\nBPMN is strictly a technique for uncovering business needs and requirements which must be addressed within the set of product requirements, with excellent results. Gap analysis is also great method for understanding business requirements. As noted, it can help determine the difference between where a business is and where it wants to be. The result may initiate a series of user requirements to help the business close that gap.\n\nWhile not covered above, a customer journey map is also beneficial for discovering business requirements. A customer journey map is a \u201cvoice-of-the-customer\u201d VOC story that shows the customer\u2019s relationship with the business over time. It helps identify sources of frustration on the part of the customer, which can inform user requirements to improve those pain points.\u00a0\u00a0*Note: limiting this analysis to just a single class of stakeholders can result in missing needs and requirements.\u00a0 A more inclusive approach is \u201cvoice-of-the-stakeholders\u201d VOX that shows relationship of all relevant stakeholders with the business over time. It helps identify sources of frustration on the part of all stakeholders, not just the customer, which can inform the definition product requirements to improve those pain points.*\n\nThe discovery of user needs and requirements benefit from techniques like the data flow diagram. As mentioned, they can be created early and give a high-level view of the data flow within a particular process. Use cases and user stories are also great tools for soliciting software requirements from a user perspective, as they maintain focus on what the user needs, not what the product does to meet those needs and wants.\n\n### Streamlining the requirements analysis process\n\nThe result of the requirements analysis phase of requirements definition and management, is the diagrams and models used as part of the analysis, an integrated set of needs, and a set of product requirements that are inputs to the design process.\u00a0 \u00a0The set of product requirements \u00a0define the features and intended behavior of the software application being created such that when implemented within the design, the stakeholder needs are met. Having a baselined set of product requirements serves to crystalize project specifics and mitigate wasted time and potential rework.\n\nWhile some organizations will communicate this set of product requirements in document form (e.g.,\u00a0 a [Software Requirements Specification](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-system-requirement-specifications-srs-documents/)), the increasing trend is to manage requirements within a requirements management software application.\n\nThe reason organizations are moving towards a data-centric practice of product development is that it is hard for any document-based approach to be flexible and scalable enough for complex agile projects. This is especially true for highly regulated industries that must prove compliance. Due to numerous factors\u2014lack of consistent updating, human error, incomplete data, version control, the need to establish and maintain traceability, etc.\u2014documents simply cannot be relied upon in determining whether a need or requirement is fulfilled.\n\nAgile product teams working on complex products in highly regulated industries will have much more success using a\u00a0[requirements management software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0application to streamline the requirements analysis phase of requirements definition and management. Modern requirements definition and management solutions, like\u00a0[Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/), help define, manage, establish traceability for, and validate complex product requirements automatically, which simplifies not only requirements analysis, but the overall requirements definition and management process.\n\nWith [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability) and [digital threads](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), Jama Connect helps teams collaborate in real time.

Stakeholder needs represent what the stakeholders need the product to do to address the problem or opportunity the product is to address; stakeholder requirements are top-level, stakeholder-defined product requirements that communicate what the stakeholders require of the product to meet their needs.\u00a0 Stakeholder needs are expressed in natural language without the use of \u201cshall\u201d, while stakeholder requirements are communicated with \u201cshall\u201d to make sure they are treated as binding requirements the product will be verified to meet.\n\nIt is important to define and understand the stakeholder needs and requirements before defining the product requirements to which the product will be designed and built. Since there are multiple stakeholders, there will be multiple sets of stakeholder needs and requirements.\u00a0 It is up to the project team to elicit these needs and requirements and to resolve conflicts, inconsistencies, and other issues.\u00a0 The results will be an integrated set of needs from which the product requirements will be transformed.\u00a0 The resulting product requirements represent what the product must do in order for the needs to meet the stated needs.\n\n[Requirements traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/) is of the utmost importance to the requirements analysis process. It is used to ensure that each requirement clearly communicates the intent of its source. Without traceability, it\u2019s nearly impossible to know if the software product meets its stakeholders\u2019 needs, goals and constraints. Requirements analysis could be executed perfectly, but without traceability of requirements to their source, there would be no way to prove you have the full, correct set of requirements.\n\nTherefore, a best practice of requirements analysis is to ensure that each requirement is traceable to all corresponding artifacts. These artifacts include not only their source but also downstream artifacts including the design, product verification planning and product validation planning.\n\nAnother equally important best practice for requirements analysis is to execute a predetermined process. Carefully performing each step can be the difference between a product\u2019s success or failure meeting stakeholder needs.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Perform Better Impact Analysis on Upstream and Downstream Relationships](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/better-impact-analysis-on-upstream-and-downstream-relationships/?utm_campaign=cta+blog)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "The requirements analysis process", "level": 3, "content": "Generally, there are seven steps in the requirements analysis process.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Common challenges during requirements analysis", "level": 3, "content": "The steps above will likely need repeating, as the most common challenge of requirements analysis is that requirements may change throughout the software development process. As the team implements various features, these steps should be repeated for each feature; doing so will often result in additional needs and requirements. The risk of change can be reduced by following the prescribed steps and getting sign off at the beginning of the project for not only the integrated product but for each feature to be provided by the software application.\n\nOne reason for change is a failure to include all relevant stakeholders. If the focus is just on the customers or users, needs and requirements associated with other stakeholders will be missed. Given the large number of different stakeholders, there will be inconsistencies, conflicts, and issues. Failure to deal with these early, will result in change. The use of various visualizations, diagrams, and models before baselining the integrated set of needs and product requirements helps ensure completeness, correctness, and consistency. Again, failing to do this before baselining the set of product requirements will result in change and lead to costly and time-consuming rework.\n\nIn other situations, it may be that some stakeholders won\u2019t know exactly what they need until they see the product in action. Project constraints may also necessitate changes in the solution. In any case, agile teams are constantly iterating and updating design. This means the process of evaluating needs and requirements almost never ends.

The result may initiate a series of user requirements to help the business close that gap.\n\nWhile not covered above, a customer journey map is also beneficial for discovering business requirements. A customer journey map is a \u201cvoice-of-the-customer\u201d VOC story that shows the customer\u2019s relationship with the business over time.

As mentioned, they can be created early and give a high-level view of the data flow within a particular process.

Having a baselined set of product requirements serves to crystalize project specifics and mitigate wasted time and potential rework.\n\nWhile some organizations will communicate this set of product requirements in document form (e.g.,\u00a0 a [Software Requirements Specification](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-system-requirement-specifications-srs-documents/)), the increasing trend is to manage requirements within a requirements management software application.\n\nThe reason organizations are moving towards a data-centric practice of product development is that it is hard for any document-based approach to be flexible and scalable enough for complex agile projects.

Requirement elicitation is the process of communicating and collaborating with key stakeholders to assemble the insight and identify the project\u2019s needs.\n\nThis article will provide an overview of why requirements elicitation is important for product teams, discuss different elicitation techniques, and outline the steps involved in eliciting requirements.\n\n### What is requirements elicitation?\n\nBusiness analysts conduct requirements elicitation to identify the business need, scope, assumptions, and risks of a project based on data from key stakeholders. It\u2019s an imperative part of requirements management as the outcome impacts the fundamental understanding of the project\u2019s goal. Failure to clearly define business needs can lead to catastrophic results such as expensive mistakes or system failure.\n\n### The importance of requirements elicitation for product teams\n\nRequirements elicitation is important for product teams because it is the main way product requirements are identified. The elicitation process unearths requirements insights from key stakeholders. By expertly asking the right questions of subject matter experts, enabling deep conversations, and recording findings, business analysts discover the true business needs to drive the project.\n\nIn the absence of properly identified business needs and requirements, development costs will be over budget due to rework, users/customers will not get what they want, and projects will be unsuccessful.\n\n### The requirement elicitation process\n\nAn effective elicitation process is important for product teams to realize the following benefits:\n\n- Lower project costs by catching requirements problems before development begins.\n- Increase the likelihood that users and customers get what they want.\n- Reduce the risk of project failure.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What is Requirements Engineering? An Overview and Intro into Requirements Engineering](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-engineering-an-overview-and-intro-into-requirements-engineering)\n\n### There are five main steps to the requirements elicitation process:\n\n### 1. Gathering requirements\n\nYou may be thinking, \u201cHow is requirements elicitation different from requirements gathering?\u201d especially when the two terms are often used interchangeably. It is a good question, and it is acceptable to casually interchange them. However, there is a slight difference between gathering requirements and requirements elicitation that is worth pointing out when discussing the specifics of the requirements elicitation process.\n\nBy definition, \u201cgathering\u201d is the act of collecting from scattered sources, while \u201celiciting\u201d is the act of drawing out information from a source. Both acts are essential to the overall process of requirements elicitation and take expertise to execute properly.\n\nAn effective way to prepare for requirements elicitation is for business analysts to gather all available requirements and study them for insights. A few techniques for requirements gathering include:\n\n- Document analysis, such as studying process models or researching regulations.\n- Analyzing system interfaces and business rules.\n- Reading available user feedback.\n\nThe findings from requirements gathering can help identify key stakeholders and inform which requirements elicitation techniques might best suit the project. Business analysts can then begin the work of drawing out the enlightening experiences that fill in the missing requirements. Therefore, requirements gathering is the perfect first step in the process of requirements elicitation.\n\n### 2. Identifying key stakeholders\n\nAs noted, requirements gathering can provide insight on relevant stakeholders. It is important to identify the right people up front so everyone can begin on the same page. Doing so eliminates the need to fill in missing requirements later that could potentially change the course of the project.\n\n### 3. Eliciting requirements from key stakeholders\n\nIn this part of the process, business analysts need to determine which requirement elicitation techniques will provide the best results given the project at hand and appropriate stakeholders.\n\nThere are a variety of requirement elicitation techniques, here are some of the most popular methods.\n\n#### Brainstorming\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0Current solutions may not be innovative enough to meet the project\u2019s goal.\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Uncover new, innovative ideas and solutions.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Assemble a mix of key stakeholders for an open conversation on innovative ideas and solutions. As facilitator, the business analyst ensures that the conversation stays on topic and records ideas discussed.\n\n#### Focus groups\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0Business analysts need more information about specific aspects of the project. Time is short.\n\n**Designed to**: Help stakeholders be more forthcoming and articulate solutions. Get a lot of information at once.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Gather representatives from stakeholder groups. The facilitator asks questions to get team members to discuss specific areas of interest and records ideas discussed.\n\n#### Interviews\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0Get an in-depth perspective from a specific subject matter expert (SME).\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Obtain a stakeholder\u2019s one-on-one insight on the business need or viability of given solutions.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Create questions that will allow the SME to be open about the issues on the table. Questions can be shared in advance or be conducted as a conversation. The interviewer should take notes and share them with the SME to ensure he or she correctly understood the SME\u2019s point of view.\n\n#### Observation\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0When the development project is an augmentation of a current work process.\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Provide a direct view of how a stakeholder performs a particular process.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Observation can be conducted passively\u2014the facilitator watches the stakeholder work without interrupting\u2014or actively\u2014the facilitator asks questions about the work as it is being performed. In both cases, the facilitator should take notes and get feedback from the stakeholder on the information collected.\n\n#### Prototyping\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0When stakeholders do not understand written technical requirements and would benefit from seeing a version of the product.\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Collect feedback from non-technical stakeholders by showing them an example with which they can physically interact.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0At first prototyping can be executed via storyboard, interactive screen, virtual mock-up, navigation flow, etc. The exact method depends on the project, but it is usually an iterative process that is improved based on input. As more requirements come forward, more detailed prototypes are created to ensure they meet the expectations as recorded.\n\n#### Requirements workshops\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0When time is short, and the business need is not clear.\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Get the stakeholders together in a structured, time-based setting to elicit, refine, and edit requirements. Stakeholders can discuss and provide immediate input on identified business needs.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Set a specific timeframe and agenda for the workshop. Include brainstorming, focus group, and prototyping (if applicable) opportunities within the schedule. Use these to guide the discussion and record input.\n\n#### Surveys\u2013\n\n**Use case:**\u00a0When business analysts need data from large groups of participants.\n\n**Designed to:**\u00a0Obtain objective feedback from large groups of customers or end-users.\n\n**How to:**\u00a0Choose participants wisely based on desired criteria. Create clear questions that do not lead the respondents. Questions can have a number of finite choices or be open-ended\u2014for best results consider the goal of the question, as well as the number of respondents, to determine the best structure for proper analysis.\n\nAs is often the case, a variety of requirements elicitation methods can be employed to unearth the business needs of a project. For example, a business analyst may ask specific requirements questions in a focus group, in a brainstorming session, or during observation. A business analyst may also conduct surveys before a requirements workshop, or create a prototype to be used during observation. Knowing which elicitation techniques to use for a given project comes with experience.\n\n### 4. Documenting requirements\n\nThe next step in the requirement elicitation process is documenting the requirements elicited thus far. There are a variety of formats for documenting requirements: a home-grown product requirements document (PRD), a government-mandated system requirements specification, a\u00a0[requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0tool like Jama Connect, a spreadsheet, etc. The best tool for documenting requirements depends on the project.\n\nIf the project has many stakeholders, complex development, or compliance or functional safety standards, it\u2019s a best practice to choose a requirements management tool like Jama Connect. These are purpose-built to mitigate risks associated with complex systems and regulatory compliance. Assessing needs and researching functionality will help determine the best option for the project\n\n### 5. Confirming the findings\n\nOnce business analysts document the requirements, it is time to make sure they are recorded correctly. Requirements are sent to all stakeholders to review so there is a collective understanding of what\u2019s being developed. Stakeholders are likely to make refinements. It is also possible that this step elicits further requirements, which will necessitate revisions before approval can take place.\n\nBusiness analysts conduct the process of requirements elicitation at the beginning of a project, and the process is ongoing throughout the development process. This is because change is always occurring and it\u2019s never possible to know all the questions to ask or have all the correct answers upfront.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Most Important Requirements Rule For Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/most-important-requirements-rule-for-better-products/)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

However, it\u2019s a much more rigorous endeavor. Here are some of the most common challenges of the requirements elicitation process.\n\n**Finding the right stakeholders\u00a0**\u2013 Identifying the correct subject matter experts isn\u2019t always easy. Hunt down \u201chidden\u201d stakeholders who can be excellent sources of knowledge. Examples include customer-facing personnel like sales/support reps and maintenance techs.\n\n**Uncovering the best insights\u00a0**\u2013 Unfortunately, stakeholders don\u2019t always know what they want. In the practice of requirements elicitation, multiple elicitation methods can be used concurrently to identify the business need and an optimal list of requirements. The expertise is in realizing the best combination of techniques to yield success for that development project.\n\n**Documenting the requirements\u00a0**\u2013 Using the wrong documentation tool for the job can be detrimental. Issues can arise with everything from reviews and approvals to managing change. Spreadsheets or home-grown PRDs may work for smaller, non-regulated projects. Complex products or those in regulated industries, on the other hand, greatly benefit from requirements management software that can streamline requirements elicitation and the overall process with features like\u00a0[live traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams)\u00a0and\u00a0[compliance management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-compliance-management-and-how-can-it-help-product-teams-ship-on-time/).\n\n**Planning for change**\u00a0\u2013 Priorities shift and problems arise\u2014it\u2019s best to plan for changes up front. Be sure to have a process in place that allows time to address problems, document changes, and add new requirements, and conduct additional reviews.\n\nAgain, in projects with fewer requirements, it won\u2019t be so grueling to scour spreadsheets or PDRs to manage change. However, this kind of manual change management can still eat up many work hours and push projects off schedule and off budget. With complex and regulated products, however, the potential for waste of time and money is much larger. In these cases, a tool like\u00a0[Jama Connect](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/why-jama/)\u00a0can save precious time and budget in the face of change. Having the right tool for the job is critical.\n\n### Streamlining the requirements elicitation process\n\nRequirements elicitation is a mixture of art and science for business analysts. They need to be adept at knowing which questions to ask and how to ask them. Additionally, business analysts must be able to clearly communicate and collaborate with key stakeholders during all phases of the elicitation process.\n\nBusiness analysts working on complex or highly regulated projects cannot rely on home-grown PRDs or spreadsheets to document requirements. The level of sophistication in which they are working demands that they have the best requirements elicitation tools at their fingertips.\n\nJama Connect is a requirements management tool that can transform how business analysts perform requirement elicitation for complex projects.

Unfortunately, it\u2019s never that straightforward.\n\nIn most cases, stakeholders are not aware of all the alternatives that exist when it comes to developing a specific product. Immersed in the current status quo, their vision tends to be limited. It\u2019s hard for users to detach from the way they\u2019re currently doing things\u2014to imagine possibilities that are a significant departure from what they have now.\n\nFurthermore, there\u2019s no silver bullet. No single requirement gathering technique will help you elicit a complete set of requirements that will fill every gap and stand up to scrutiny during validation.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s a good idea to take a multi-faceted approach to requirements gathering. Requirements engineering best practices recommend using a variety of methods aimed at different phases of the process.\n\nThis article looks at eleven effective requirements gathering techniques. They will be presented roughly in the order in which they normally appear in the requirements gathering process. It is not necessary to use all of them for every project, but a healthy mix of these techniques, chosen based on the needs of your specific project, will likely improve your requirements coverage and help you reduce requirements-related problems during software development and afterward.\n\n- Interviews\n- Questionnaires or Surveys\n- User Observation\n- Document Analysis\n- Interface Analysis\n- Workshops\n- Brainstorming\n- Role-Play\n- Use Cases and Scenarios\n- Focus Groups\n- Prototyping\n\n### #1: Interviews\n\nInterviews are a great way to start the requirements elicitation process. They are invaluable for gathering background information on business needs, customers\u2019 and users\u2019 problems, and the concerns of support staff and other relevant stakeholders. Interviews can also be used in follow-up to gather more detailed information.\n\nInterviews should cover a diverse and representative cross-section of the system\u2019s stakeholders. You will want to include the full range of customer and user profiles. This is necessary to gain a proper perspective on competing needs, so your system requirements aren\u2019t slanted in favor of one group.\n\nWhen you conduct interviews, it is important to ask open-ended questions. Open-ended questions are those that cannot be answered with a simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d They draw out specific information. They require the interviewee to explain their thoughts and provide reasons, which in turn provides context for evaluating and validating the requirements.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to ask a lot of follow-up questions during the interview. Good follow-up questions either drill down for more detail or pull up to get an overview of the context. Some people will tend to talk specifics and exceptions. With them, you\u2019ll need to pull up. Others will talk about context without ever getting into specifics. With those folks, you\u2019ll need to drill down.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Characteristics of Effective Software Requirements and Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/characteristics-of-excellent-requirements/)\n\n### Technique #2: Questionnaires or Surveys\n\nIndividual interviews present several challenges. They can be tricky to schedule and time-consuming for the interviewers. Plus, the requirements you gather may only scratch the surface; not every interviewer is skilled at asking follow-up questions in real time.\n\nQuestionnaires (or surveys) can provide an efficient alternative. They allow follow-up with multiple stakeholders at the same time.\n\nA well-thought-out questionnaire\u2014one that asks probing questions\u2014is a good tool for getting at those underlying requirements of which stakeholders may not be fully conscious, but which are essential to a successful design.\n\n### Technique #3: User Observation\n\nOne of the best ways to understand what users truly need is to observe them performing their daily tasks.\n\nUser observation can be either passive or active. Active observation\u2014asking questions of users while observing them\u2014is the best approach for gaining an understanding of an existing process. Passive observation is more effective when gathering user feedback on a design prototype (see technique #11).\n\nWhen observing users, record the actions and activities that take place. What already works well? What causes users difficulty? Note the obstacles users must routinely overcome.\n\nBy observing end users in the real context in which they perform their tasks, you\u2019ll gain a true understanding of what they are up against and what improvements they need so they can perform better. You\u2019ll then be better able to specify a system that successfully reinvents users\u2019 processes and grants them far greater productivity and usability, rather than simply providing them an incremental improvement.\n\n### Technique #4: Document Analysis\n\nFrequently overlooked, document analysis is another highly effective technique for gathering requirements.\n\nReviewing the documentation of the current system you\u2019re seeking to replace can help you in performing AS-IS process analysis and gap analysis. The former helps you see where you can improve the user\u2019s process. The latter will aid you in determining where the business needs revealed earlier\u2014through your interviews, questionnaires, and user observation\u2014are not being met.\n\nNaturally, you\u2019ll want to analyze the system\u2019s requirements documents, if available, but you should also look at other system-level documentation, such as users\u2019 manuals and problem reports.\n\nNuggets of information on why the existing system works as it does are often buried within the specifications and design documentation. The insights gained from document analysis can help you formulate further questions and evaluate the completeness of your requirement set.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Most Important Requirements Rule For Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/most-important-requirements-rule-for-better-products/)\n\n### Requirements Gathering Technique #5: Interface Analysis\n\nAnalyzing a system\u2019s interfaces, both human and machine, is vitally important to ensure requirements are complete and the system will be usable.\n\nInterfaces for a software product will include those with:\n\n- End users\n- System components the software interacts with (e.g., sensors or other peripherals)\n- External systems the software interacts with\n\nThorough interface analysis\u2014really understanding the interactive context of the system\u2014 will frequently uncover requirements not readily visible to users.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Explore various what-if scenarios and blue-sky ideas. The general idea is to break away from existing conventions. Consider visionary ideas for pushing current boundaries.\n\nUseful tools for brainstorming sessions include whiteboards, mind mapping software, and empathy maps (the latter for exploring user needs).\n\n### Technique #7: Workshops\n\nWhen gathering requirements from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, it\u2019s only natural that you\u2019ll get conflicting opinions. You will need to resolve these issues, however, before implementation begins.\n\nRequirements workshops are a good method for resolving such conflicts.\n\nOnce you have a broad set of candidate requirements defined and organized, convene your stakeholders and hash through these candidates together. Gather additional detail. Give a fair hearing to opposing views. Grant everyone ample opportunity to provide the rationale for their positions.\n\nSeek to resolve discrepancies and conflicts, gain consensus, and validate your requirements. These activities are vital to ensuring your system will best meet the needs of all users and stakeholders, not just the most vocal groups.\n\n### Technique #8: Role-play\n\nSome systems\u2014certain kinds of enterprise software, like ERP, for example\u2014must meet the needs of a variety of user types. Role-play can help to ensure that the needs of all users are being met.\n\nIn a role-play session, different people take the roles of the different user types. Having the various roles interact with one another helps examine individual system requirements from different perspectives and generates discussions and new ideas.\n\nIn effect, role-play is an additional brainstorming technique. It is a good way to gain a solid understanding of how the various parts of the system need to function to support the overall process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Agile for the Enterprise: 5 Steps to Helping Teams Move More Effectively](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/agile-for-the-enterprise)\n\n### Requirements Gathering Technique #9: Use Cases and Scenarios\n\nOnce you have high-level functional requirements in place, it is a good idea to explore a variety of use cases and scenarios.\n\nUse cases are the specific, individual business objectives the system must accomplish and the various situations in which a given feature or functionality will be used. They describe the various external entities that act on the system and the specific interactions they have with the system to accomplish the business objective. Use cases are expressed as step-by-step lists of tasks performed during a process.\n\nScenarios, also called user stories, are similar to use cases in that they describe how the system will carry out a process to fulfill a business objective. Their form, however, is a narrative, rather than an enumerated list. They are essentially short stories with the user in the role of the protagonist. Scenarios describe:\n\n- Tasks users perform\n- Information users see\n- How users interact with the system\n\nUse cases and scenarios can be used to validate the features and functional requirements of the system across a wide range of situations. They can also help you discover exceptions and boundary cases that need consideration.\n\n### Requirements Gathering Technique #10: Focus Groups\n\nA focus group (or user group) is a gathering of customers or user representatives who meet with you to\n\n- Provide feedback on your product\n- Express their needs\n- Help guide your software development\n\nFocus groups can be convened to either:\n\n- Gather information for the development of requirements, or\n- Gain feedback aimed at validated previously elicited requirements\n\nFocus groups are different from brainstorming. Brainstorming is a managed process that generally involves internal stakeholders. Focus groups typically involve external stakeholders.\n\nMany systems engineers and business analysts are skeptical of using focus groups to gather requirements. Meetings can be dominated by vocal individuals with narrow agendas. Strong disagreements on needs and features can make these meetings unproductive.\u00a0Focus groups\u00a0can, however, be extremely useful in certain situations. One of these is the evaluation of design prototypes (see technique #11) to help validate and finalize requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-and-traceability-solution)\n\n### Requirements Gathering Technique #11: Prototyping\n\nThere\u2019s an old joke among systems engineers that the discussion with a user group following a design presentation often goes something like this\u2026\n\n*System engineer:\u00a0*\u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d\n\n*User group:*\u00a0\u201cWe hate it.\u201d\n\n*System engineer:\u00a0*\u201cAh\u2026 okay, well\u2026 what is it you want, then?\u201d\n\n*User group:*\u00a0\u201cWell\u2026 we don\u2019t know\u2026 BUT IT AIN\u2019T THAT!\u201d\n\nOften, end users and other stakeholders don\u2019t have a clear idea of what they truly want. In most cases, they don\u2019t have a good grasp of what\u2019s possible. If you can give them something to try, however, they can usually tell you what they like and don\u2019t like about it.\n\nThat\u2019s where prototyping comes in.\n\nPrototyping gives users a chance to try out ideas on what their next solution could look like. Today\u2019s rapid prototyping tools allow developers to quickly put together any number of interactive mock-ups for users to try.\n\nOnce the initial mock-up is built, the process is an iterative one:\n\n- Trial of the prototype by users\n- Feedback from users\n- Modification of the prototype\n\nModern prototyping tools make it easy for developers to modify the prototype on the fly, so users can help you quickly discover what will satisfy them. From that working model, it\u2019s then a relatively simple matter to reverse engineer the requirements that describe the accepted functionality.\n\n### Automating the Requirement Gathering Process\n\nAs you gather and develop requirements, it is beneficial to have a flexible, user-friendly system for collecting them, organizing them, and making them available to relevant stakeholders. This is especially true in agile development where documents and spreadsheets can prove especially cumbersome.\n\nTo see how Jama Connect can streamline requirements gathering and management for Agile teams,\u00a0[click here](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/).\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss Requirements Engineering as a Path to Project Success\n\nDEFINITION OF AGILE PRODUCT TEAMS\n\n**AGILE PRODUCT TEAMS** refer to the agile product development process.

Requirements gathering is often regarded as a part of [developing software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/industrial-manufacturing?primary_topic=product-systems-and-software-development) applications or of cyber-physical systems like aircraft, spacecraft, and automobiles (where specifications cover both software and hardware). It can, however, be applied to any product or project, from designing a new sailboat to building a patio deck to remodeling a bathroom.\n\n### Three Main Subprocesses of Requirements Gathering\n\nThe\u00a0key ingredients\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0requirements gathering\u00a0process\u00a0are\u00a0three overlapping\u00a0subprocesses: requirements elicitation, requirements documentation, and requirements understanding.\n\n**Requirements\u00a0elicitation**\u00a0[is the process of\u00a0asking for and\u00a0collecting\u00a0top-level requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-gathering-and-management-processes/11-requirements-gathering-techniques-for-agile-product-teams) from\u00a0all\u00a0relevant stakeholders.\u00a0Effort should be made to account for the needs of customers,\u00a0their\u00a0users,\u00a0the\u00a0internal stakeholders within your own company, and\u00a0your key\u00a0suppliers.\n\n**Requirements\u00a0documentation**\u00a0organizes the input from the\u00a0requirements elicitation\u00a0process into\u00a0whatever format is\u00a0appropriate for your organization.\u00a0This formatting may include:\n\n- User stories\n- Functional decompositions (especially\u00a0for complex\u00a0cyber-physical\u00a0systems)\n- Feature\u00a0descriptions\n\nThese will be collected in a top-level requirements specification like a\u00a0[product requirements document (PRD)](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-write-an-effective-product-requirements-document?utm_campaign=related+blog)\u00a0or a system specification. The purpose of this\u00a0top-level specification\u00a0is to\u00a0make those stories\u00a0and descriptions\u00a0available to all members of the project team.\n\n**Requirements\u00a0confirmation**\u00a0is the process of making sure all stakeholders and team members have a common understanding\u00a0of\u00a0what you\u2019re trying to build. This involves reviewing and refining the requirements. It will\u00a0very likely\u00a0require additional elicitation\u00a0and\u00a0revision of the\u00a0documentation\u00a0as well.\n\n### What are the Benefits of Requirements Gathering?\n\nBeyond the obvious advantage of having requirements with which to\u00a0work,\u00a0a\u00a0good requirements\u00a0gathering process offers the following benefits:\n\n- **Greatly improves the chances that customers and users will get what they wanted.**\u00a0Stakeholders often have difficulty putting into words exactly what it is that they\u00a0need.

Here are some of the\u00a0main challenges:\n\n#### Finding All the Right Stakeholders\n\nProjects often have \u201chidden\u201d stakeholders.\u00a0It\u2019s important to uncover them.\u00a0The group you canvas should include more than just\u00a0the obvious decision-makers.\u00a0Don\u2019t forget\u00a0to talk to customer support reps, maintenance technicians,\u00a0and others who come into\u00a0direct\u00a0contact with\u00a0customers.\u00a0\u00a0They\u00a0are\u00a0themselves, in effect, users\u00a0of your existing products.\n\n\u201cDisgruntled users who are forced to use a system every day that was designed without their input are a key ingredient for a failed project,\u201d\u00a0says\u00a0Jordan Hirsch,\u00a0Director of Innovation\u00a0at\u00a0[Phase2 Technology](https://www.phase2technology.com/).\n\n#### Understanding What Stakeholders Really Want\n\nYour stakeholders may not have a clear vision of what they want.\u00a0They may not be able to tell you a complete story. They may have\u00a0hidden pain points or desires, unstated goals, or assumptions. You\u2019re going to have to ask a lot of probing questions\u00a0and compare answers.\u00a0You\u2019re also going to have to go through several iterations of your process\u00a0to arrive at a consensus.\n\n#### Planning for Change\n\nThroughout\u00a0the\u00a0requirements gathering process, you\u2019re going to\u00a0come across\u00a0questions you forgot to\u00a0ask\u00a0and\u00a0things stakeholders forgot\u00a0to\u00a0tell you. You\u2019ll come up against shifting priorities\u00a0and problems encountered during implementation.\n\nIt\u2019s wise to have a plan\u00a0for\u00a0dealing\u00a0with\u00a0those changes.\u00a0You\u2019ll need to allow time for addressing problems, documenting new requirements,\u00a0and\u00a0conducting additional reviews.\n\n### A 6-Step Requirements Gathering Process\n\nThe requirements gathering process consists of six steps. Three of those (steps three through five\u2014the bulk of the process) we\u2019ve already mentioned as the key subprocesses of requirements gathering. The full six steps are:\n\n- Identify the relevant stakeholders\n- Establish project goals and objectives\n- Elicit requirements from stakeholders\n- Document the requirements\n- Confirm the requirements\n- Prioritize the requirements\n\nIt is important to note that\u00a0while\u00a0these\u00a0steps\u00a0are typically initiated\u00a0in the order listed,\u00a0there is a great deal of overlap\u00a0and iteration among them. It may, therefore, be better to think of them as subprocesses rather than steps\u00a0as we look at each one individually.\n\n#### Identify the Relevant Stakeholders\n\nFind\u00a0qualified representatives from each\u00a0relevant stakeholder group. Depending on your project,\u00a0these\u00a0may\u00a0include:\n\n- Customers stakeholders\n- Decision-makers\n- Users\n- System administrators\n- Other impacted customer\u00a0departments\n- Internal stakeholders\n- Executives\n- Engineering\n- Marketing\n- Sales\n- Customer support\u00a0(including on-site maintenance teams, if applicable)\n- Key suppliers\n- Distributers and other partners\n\nRemember to search for \u201chidden stakeholders.\u201d\u00a0Ask probing questions in early meetings, before you begin eliciting requirements.\u00a0Identify all stakeholder groups who need to be involved.\u00a0Ideally, you want input from every group\u00a0who has skin in the game; give\u00a0them all\u00a0the opportunity to\u00a0state\u00a0their needs.\n\n#### Establish Project Goals and Objectives\n\nWhat are you trying to achieve\u00a0with this new product or project?\u00a0What are the overall outcomes your [customers](https://www.jamasoftware.com/resources?resource_type=customer-story) want from the product? What are your company\u2019s business goals?\u00a0What are the actionable, measurable objectives\u00a0you need to achieve to realize those goals and outcomes?\n\nWrite them down. State them clearly, and get all your stakeholders to sign-off on them. Your goals and objectives will act as a framework for your decision-making.\n\nEach\u00a0requirement\u00a0you write\u00a0should\u00a0help\u00a0satisfy a project objective and accomplish a goal.\u00a0If it doesn\u2019t,\u00a0you\u00a0should either discard\u00a0it\u00a0or made\u00a0it\u00a0a\u00a0candidate for\u00a0a\u00a0future release.\n\n#### Elicit Requirements From Your Stakeholders\n\nThis is the first of three\u00a0requirements gathering subprocesses which are highly iterative\u00a0and overlapping.\u00a0Even in an agile environment, you are likely to go through several cycles of elicitation, documentation,\u00a0and\u00a0review/confirmation before you achieve a\u00a0workable\u00a0specification to begin development.\n\nElicitation\u00a0can be performed\u00a0in several ways. Time-tested techniques include\u00a0surveys, questionnaires,\u00a0and interviews.\u00a0Interviews\u00a0and follow-up meetings\u00a0will be\u00a0prevalent during later iterations.\n\nBe sure to listen actively during interviews.\u00a0Ask probing questions and take copious notes.\u00a0Afterward, organize your notes and follow up as necessary.\u00a0Document each\u00a0exercise\u00a0or\u00a0encounter thoroughly.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

That could\u00a0be\u00a0a product requirements document (PRD)\u00a0of your\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0design, a\u00a0government-mandated\u00a0system requirements specification,\u00a0a\u00a0vendor-supplied\u00a0[requirements management\u00a0(RM)\u00a0](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/?utm_campaign=related+blog)tool\u00a0like Jama Connect,\u00a0a spreadsheet, a database,\u00a0or any other\u00a0appropriate\u00a0repository\u00a0your entire team can access.\n\nWhat\u2019s most important is\u00a0that the requirements documentation\u2026\n\n- Can\u00a0be\u00a0easily navigated and understood\u00a0by your team\n- Is available\u00a0for review\u00a0by\u00a0all stakeholders\n- Provides a facility for traceability\u00a0to\u00a0other documentation.\n\nTemplates are extremely useful, both for the\u00a0specification as a whole and for individual requirements.\u00a0Solid, battle-tested templates\u00a0and\u00a0standardized formats\u00a0help provide clarity and aid navigation.\n\n#### Confirm the Requirements\n\nReview\u00a0the\u00a0requirements\u00a0with all stakeholders.\u00a0Make sure the\u00a0requirements\u00a0clearly capture what was intended\u00a0and that\u00a0all parties have a common understanding of each\u00a0of them. If you find\u00a0any ambiguity\u00a0in a requirement, revise it.\n\nYou should also validate your requirements\u00a0through prototyping\u00a0and testing,\u00a0where possible.\u00a0Modern prototyping tools\u00a0make it fast and easy to create a working model of your specification. You can then use that model to perform\u00a0feasibility, usability,\u00a0and product concept testing.\n\nGet stakeholder sign-off on individual requirements as\u00a0you get them nailed down. Do the same for\u00a0the\u00a0specification\u00a0as a whole during a final review.\n\n#### Prioritize the Requirements\n\nMost engineering development programs run into unexpected challenges along the way.\u00a0Unanticipated obstacles are encountered.\u00a0Schedules\u00a0slip. Priorities change.\u00a0It\u2019s important to be able to\u00a0adapt to those challenges and changes.\n\nThat\u2019s why\u00a0it is\u00a0crucial\u00a0to prioritize your requirements\u00a0based on\u00a0how each will impact your goals and objectives for your release.\n\nMany product managers prioritize features by tagging them with labels, such as \u201cmust have,\u201d \u201chigh want,\u201d and \u201cnice to have.\u201d But it\u2019s also important to rank order each requirement within those categories. There are two reasons for this.\n\nThe first is time to market. Schedules often slip. When they do, you may need to trim features and requirements to meet your release date. You don\u2019t want your team implementing the easiest requirements first only to find that there\u2019s not enough time to complete all your must-haves.\n\nThe second reason is that requirements evolve. During implementation, you\u2019re likely to discover new needs. Some may be critically important and supersede existing requirements in terms of priority. You need to know where those new requirements fit in your pecking order. If you don\u2019t, less important factors will determine what gets implemented first, which may have\u00a0an adverse\u00a0impact on your product\u2019s success.\n\n### Common Requirements Gathering Pitfalls\n\n#### \n\n#### Making Assumptions About What You\u2019ve Heard\n\nBeware of simple, broad requirements.\u00a0Don\u2019t assume you know exactly what they mean.\u00a0Above all, don\u2019t assume all your stakeholders interpret those requirements in the same way.\n\nBroad\u00a0statements\u00a0like,\u00a0\u201cThe site shall have a blog\u201d\u00a0can mask a host of underlying assumptions. Scrutinize\u00a0such\u00a0requirements.\u00a0Ask lots of questions. How will posts be displayed?\u00a0How should authors be managed?\u00a0How about comments, categories, tagging?\u00a0Should there be an RSS feed?\u2026 and so forth.\n\nCross-check\u00a0the answers you receive.\u00a0Then come up\u00a0with\u00a0a set of\u00a0more specific, verifiable requirements\u00a0that\u00a0everyone can agree\u00a0upon.\n\n#### Focusing on HOW Instead of WHAT\n\nRequirements address two things. The first is\u00a0WHAT\u00a0the\u00a0product must do\u00a0(the\u00a0functional requirements).\u00a0The second is\u00a0the\u00a0necessary\u00a0constraints\u00a0on how the product does what it does\u00a0(the\u00a0non-functional requirements).\n\nRequirements should not address\u00a0HOW\u00a0the product does what it has to do.\u00a0In other words, your specification should be as\u00a0implementation-agnostic\u00a0as possible, within the constraints of the non-functional requirements.\n\nDuring requirements elicitation, try not to think about how you\u2019re going to implement the product. Forget about the latest technology your engineering department is obsessed with, your software team\u2019s tool du jour, the features you feel are missing from the product baseline. Focus instead on your stakeholders\u2019 needs.\n\nListen to what your stakeholders are saying\u00a0first.\u00a0Then gather, review\u00a0and refine your requirements.\u00a0Finally, once you\u2019ve\u00a0done\u00a0all that,\u00a0find the gaps in your baseline, and determine which\u00a0technologies will deliver what your\u00a0customers and\u00a0stakeholders\u00a0really\u00a0want.\n\n#### Insufficient Consultation With Stakeholders\n\nPerhaps the biggest mistake\u00a0systems engineers and product managers make in gathering\u00a0requirements is failing to\u00a0adequately consult with\u00a0their\u00a0stakeholders.\u00a0Stakeholder consultation has several facets.\n\nFirst, it is critically important that you\u00a0drill down\u00a0(and follow up)\u00a0with each stakeholder group\u00a0to fully understand\u00a0their\u00a0needs.\u00a0Failure to do so is one of the leading causes of\u00a0requirements failures.\n\nA second important facet is\u00a0transparency.\u00a0Clean up\u00a0your\u00a0notes\u00a0and share them after every interview, meeting,\u00a0and survey. The easiest way to do this is\u00a0through a\u00a0modern RM tool\u00a0to which all\u00a0team members have\u00a0access.\u00a0Tools like Jama Connect\u00a0allow you to attach notes to the requirements themselves\u00a0for traceability purposes.\u00a0This greatly increases the speed of the process and\u00a0simplifies\u00a0the review task.\n\nThe third\u00a0potential\u00a0pitfall in this\u00a0area is\u00a0insufficient review.\u00a0Be sure to hold\u00a0reviews\u00a0where stakeholders can\u00a0review the requirements, provide feedback, voice objections, and defend their positions.\u00a0Open discussions\u00a0involving all concerned stakeholders can\u00a0help uncover and correct requirements flaws\u00a0and achieve consensus.\n\nFinally, get all your stakeholders to sign-off on the requirements to acknowledge that they understand them and that the requirements are sufficient for them to do their jobs. Be sure to make it clear to the stakeholder what his or her signature means.\n\n## Best Practices for Requirements Gathering\n\nAny project\u2019s success depends on the efficient collection of requirements, which guarantees stakeholder alignment and produces a product that satisfies user needs. The following are recommended processes to stick to:\n\n**1. Involve Stakeholders (Big and Small) Frequently and Early**\n\nEngage important parties early on, such as clients, end users, and subject matter experts. Their observations reduce misconceptions later in the development process and aid in the definition of precise, pertinent criteria.\n\n**2. Employ a Variety of Elicitation Methods**\n\nRequirements may be expressed differently by various parties. To get a complete picture of project needs, use a variety of methods, including surveys, brainstorming sessions, seminars, and interviews.\n\n**3. Establish Specific, Measurable Needs**\n\nSpecific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements are known as SMART requirements. To avoid misunderstandings, steer clear of unclear or vague wording.\n\n**4. Prioritize Requirements**\n\nNot all requirements are equally important. Categorize them based on business impact, feasibility, and urgency to ensure that high-priority needs are addressed first.\n\n**5. Preserve End-to-End Traceability**\n\nClearly define the relationship between project deliverables and requirements. Throughout the project lifecycle, alignment is ensured via tools such as requirements management software, which aid in tracking changes.\n\n**6. Cultivate Collaboration and Communication **\n\nPromote open communication between the quality assurance, development, and QA teams. A common understanding lowers the possibility of missing important requirements and their dependencies.\n\n**7. Verify and Validate Frequently **\n\nMake sure requirements are still relevant by reviewing and validating them frequently with stakeholders. By doing this, scope creep and expensive rework are avoided. Teams may increase project success, lower project risks, and improve clarity by adhering to these best practices, which will result in better solutions that satisfy user and business needs.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How Better Requirements Management \u2014 and Requirements Management Tools \u2014 Can Improve Your Product Development Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/most-important-requirements-rule-for-better-products/)\n\n### Requirements Gathering for Agile Development\n\nWhat\u2019s different about requirements gathering for Agile?\n\nFirst off, agile teams expect to move fast.

The following are recommended processes to stick to:\n\n**1. Involve Stakeholders (Big and Small) Frequently and Early**\n\nEngage important parties early on, such as clients, end users, and subject matter experts. Their observations reduce misconceptions later in the development process and aid in the definition of precise, pertinent criteria.\n\n**2. Employ a Variety of Elicitation Methods**\n\nRequirements may be expressed differently by various parties. To get a complete picture of project needs, use a variety of methods, including surveys, brainstorming sessions, seminars, and interviews.\n\n**3. Establish Specific, Measurable Needs**\n\nSpecific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound requirements are known as SMART requirements. To avoid misunderstandings, steer clear of unclear or vague wording.\n\n**4. Prioritize Requirements**\n\nNot all requirements are equally important. Categorize them based on business impact, feasibility, and urgency to ensure that high-priority needs are addressed first.\n\n**5. Preserve End-to-End Traceability**\n\nClearly define the relationship between project deliverables and requirements. Throughout the project lifecycle, alignment is ensured via tools such as requirements management software, which aid in tracking changes.\n\n**6. Cultivate Collaboration and Communication **\n\nPromote open communication between the quality assurance, development, and QA teams. A common understanding lowers the possibility of missing important requirements and their dependencies.\n\n**7. Verify and Validate Frequently **\n\nMake sure requirements are still relevant by reviewing and validating them frequently with stakeholders. By doing this, scope creep and expensive rework are avoided. Teams may increase project success, lower project risks, and improve clarity by adhering to these best practices, which will result in better solutions that satisfy user and business needs.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How Better Requirements Management \u2014 and Requirements Management Tools \u2014 Can Improve Your Product Development Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/most-important-requirements-rule-for-better-products/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Requirements Gathering for Agile Development", "level": 3, "content": "What\u2019s different about requirements gathering for Agile?\n\nFirst off, agile teams expect to move fast.

This is the classic waterfall paradigm. It doesn\u2019t work well in most situations. It\u2019s far more realistic to define a requirements baseline and then manage changes to that baseline.\n\n### What is a Requirements Baseline?\n\nA requirements baseline is a**\u00a0**snapshot in time that represents an agreed-upon, reviewed, and approved set of requirements that have been committed to a specific product release.\n\nThat \u201crelease\u201d could be a complete delivered product or any interim development increment of the product. When stakeholders \u201csign-off\u201d on requirements, what they\u2019re really doing is agreeing and committing to a specific requirements baseline (whether they think of it in those terms or not).\n\nOnce the project team establishes a requirements baseline, the team should follow a pragmatic change control process to make good business and technical decisions about adding newly-requested functionality and altering or deleting existing requirements.\n\nA change control process is not about stifling change; it\u2019s about providing decision-makers with the information that will let them make timely and appropriate decisions to modify the planned functionality. That planned functionality is the baseline.\n\nTypically, a baseline is also given a unique name so that all the project participants can refer to it unambiguously. And good configuration management practices allow the team to reconstruct accurately any previous baseline and all its components.\n\n### Implementing a Requirements Baseline\n\nWhereas the scope definition distinguishes what\u2019s in from what\u2019s out, the requirements baseline explicitly identifies only those requirement specifications that the project will implement. A baseline is not a tangible item but rather a defined list of items. One possible storage location is a software requirements specification (SRS) document.\n\nIf that\u00a0[SRS document](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/characteristics-of-excellent-requirements/)\u00a0contains only\u2014and all\u2014the requirements for a specific product release, the SRS constitutes the requirements baseline for the release. However, the SRS document might include additional, lower-priority requirements that are intended for a later release.\n\nConversely, a large project might need several software, hardware, and interface requirement specifications to fully define the baseline\u2019s components. The goal is to provide the project stakeholders with a clear understanding of exactly what is intended to go into the upcoming release.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re storing your requirements in a requirements management solution rather than in documents. In that case, you can define a baseline as a specific subset of the requirements stored in the database that are planned for a given release.\n\nStoring requirements in an RM solution allows you to maintain an aggregated set of both currently committed requirements and planned future requirements. Some commercial requirements management tools include a baselining function to distinguish those requirements (perhaps even down to the specific version of each requirement) that belong to a certain baseline.\n\nAlternatively, you could define a requirement attribute in the solution to hold the release number or another baseline identifier. Moving a requirement from one baseline to another is then a simple matter of changing the value for that requirement attribute.\n\nThe attribute approach will work when each requirement belongs to only a single baseline. However, you might well allocate the same requirement (or different versions of the same requirement) to several baselines if you\u2019re concurrently developing multiple versions of your product, such as home and professional versions. Tool support is essential for such complex baseline management.\n\nWhen following an incremental or iterative development life cycle, the baseline for each iteration will represent just a fraction of the overall system\u2019s functionality.\n\nFor example, a small project our team once worked on took this approach. This project worked in three-week release cycles. For each cycle, the BA specified the software requirements that were to be designed, coded, integrated, and verified during the next three weeks. Each requirements baseline was therefore quite small. In a classic Agile approach, the product grew incrementally toward full functionality as the developer periodically released useful versions to the users.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Conquering the 5 Biggest Challenges of Requirements Management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/conquering-the-5-biggest-challenges-of-requirements-management-part-i/)\n\n### When to Perform a Baseline\n\nBusiness analysts sometimes struggle with exactly when to define a requirements baseline. It\u2019s an important decision because establishing the baseline has the following implications:\n\n**Formal change control begins.**\u00a0Change requests are made against an established baseline. The baseline. therefore, provides the point of reference for each proposed change. Make sure your change control process and players are in place before you define any project baselines.\n\n**Project managers determine the staffing levels and budgets needed.\u00a0**There are five dimensions to a software project that must be managed: features, quality, schedule, staff, and budget. Once the features and quality goals are defined in the baseline, the project manager adjusts the other three dimensions to accomplish the project\u2019s objectives. It can work the other way, too. If staff, budget, and/or schedule are pre-established by external forces, the baseline composition is necessarily constrained to fit inside the project box bounded by those limits.\n\n**Project managers make schedule commitments.**\u00a0Prior to baselining, requirements are still volatile and uncertain, so estimates are similarly volatile and uncertain. Once a baseline is established, the contents of the release should be sufficiently well understood so that managers can make realistically achievable commitments. The managers still need to anticipate requirements\u2019 growth (per their requirements management plan) by including sensible contingency buffers in their committed schedules.\n\nBaselining requirements too early can push your change process into overdrive. In fact, receiving a storm of change requests after defining a baseline could be a clue that your requirements elicitation activities were incomplete and perhaps ineffective. On the other hand, waiting too long to establish a baseline could be a sign of analysis paralysis:\u00a0 perhaps the BA is trying too hard to perfect the set of requirements before handing them to the development team.\n\nKeep in mind that requirements elicitation attempts to define a set of requirements that is\u00a0*good enough\u00a0*to let the team proceed with construction at an acceptable level of risk. Use the checklist in Table 1 to judge when you\u2019re ready to define a requirements baseline as a solid foundation for continuing the development effort.\n\nTable 1. Factors to Consider Before Defining a Requirements Baseline\n\n| Business Rules | Determine whether you\u2019ve identified the business rules that affect the system and whether you\u2019ve specified functionality to enforce or comply with those rules. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Change Control | Make sure a practical change control process is in place for dealing with requirement changes and that the change control board is assembled and chartered. Ensure that the change control tool you plan to use is in place and configured and that the tool users have been trained. |\n| CustomerPerspective | Check back with your key customer representatives to see whether their needs have changed since you last spoke. Have new business rules come into play? Have existing rules been modified? Have priorities changed? Have new customers with different needs been identified? |\n| Interfaces | See if functionality has been defined to handle all identified external interfaces to users, other software systems, hardware components, and communications services. |\n| Model Validation | Examine any analysis models with the user representatives, perhaps by walking through test cases, to see if a system based on those models would let the users perform their necessary activities. |\n| Prototypes | If you created any prototypes, did appropriate customers evaluate them? Did the BA use the knowledge gained to revise the SRS? |\n| Alignment | Check to see if the defined set of requirements would likely achieve the project\u2019s business objectives. Look for alignment between the business requirements, user requirements, and functional requirements. |\n| Reviews | Have several downstream consumers of the requirements review them. These consumers include designers, programmers, testers, documentation and help writers, human factors specialists, and anyone else who will base their own work on the requirements. |\n| Scope | Confirm that all requirements being considered for the baseline are within the project scope as it is currently defined. The scope might have changed since it was originally defined early in the project. |\n| TBDs | Scan the documents for TBDs (details yet to be determined). The TBDs represent requirements development work remaining to be done. |\n| Templates | Make sure that each section of the SRS document template has been populated. Alternatively, look for an indication that certain sections do not apply to this project. Common oversights are quality requirements, constraints, and assumptions. |\n| User Classes | See whether you\u2019ve received input from appropriate representatives of all the user classes you\u2019ve identified for the product. |\n| Verifiability | Determine how you would judge whether each requirement was properly implemented. User acceptance criteria are helpful for this. |\n\nYou\u2019re never going to get perfect, complete requirements. The BA and project manager must judge whether the requirements are converging toward a product description that will satisfy some defined portion of customer needs and is achievable within the known project constraints.\n\nEstablishing a baseline at that point establishes a mutual agreement and expectation among the project stakeholders regarding the product they\u2019re going to have when they\u2019re done. Without such an agreed-upon baseline, there\u2019s a good chance someone will be surprised by the outcome of the project.\n\nAnd [software surprises are rarely good news](https://brainhub.eu/library/cost-of-quality-in-software-development/).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn How Working with Baselines Benefit Product Development\n\nDEFINITION OF A BASELINE:\n\n**A Baseline Is** an approved version of items such as Requirements, Tests, etc.\n\nPREVIOUSWhat is Requirements Gathering?\n\nNEXT UPManaging Project Scope \u2014 Why It Matters and Best Practices\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

That planned functionality is the baseline.\n\nTypically, a baseline is also given a unique name so that all the project participants can refer to it unambiguously. And good configuration management practices allow the team to reconstruct accurately any previous baseline and all its components.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Implementing a Requirements Baseline", "level": 3, "content": "Whereas the scope definition distinguishes what\u2019s in from what\u2019s out, the requirements baseline explicitly identifies only those requirement specifications that the project will implement. A baseline is not a tangible item but rather a defined list of items. One possible storage location is a software requirements specification (SRS) document.\n\nIf that\u00a0[SRS document](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/characteristics-of-excellent-requirements/)\u00a0contains only\u2014and all\u2014the requirements for a specific product release, the SRS constitutes the requirements baseline for the release. However, the SRS document might include additional, lower-priority requirements that are intended for a later release.\n\nConversely, a large project might need several software, hardware, and interface requirement specifications to fully define the baseline\u2019s components. The goal is to provide the project stakeholders with a clear understanding of exactly what is intended to go into the upcoming release.\n\nPerhaps you\u2019re storing your requirements in a requirements management solution rather than in documents. In that case, you can define a baseline as a specific subset of the requirements stored in the database that are planned for a given release.\n\nStoring requirements in an RM solution allows you to maintain an aggregated set of both currently committed requirements and planned future requirements. Some commercial requirements management tools include a baselining function to distinguish those requirements (perhaps even down to the specific version of each requirement) that belong to a certain baseline.\n\nAlternatively, you could define a requirement attribute in the solution to hold the release number or another baseline identifier. Moving a requirement from one baseline to another is then a simple matter of changing the value for that requirement attribute.\n\nThe attribute approach will work when each requirement belongs to only a single baseline. However, you might well allocate the same requirement (or different versions of the same requirement) to several baselines if you\u2019re concurrently developing multiple versions of your product, such as home and professional versions. Tool support is essential for such complex baseline management.\n\nWhen following an incremental or iterative development life cycle, the baseline for each iteration will represent just a fraction of the overall system\u2019s functionality.\n\nFor example, a small project our team once worked on took this approach. This project worked in three-week release cycles. For each cycle, the BA specified the software requirements that were to be designed, coded, integrated, and verified during the next three weeks. Each requirements baseline was therefore quite small. In a classic Agile approach, the product grew incrementally toward full functionality as the developer periodically released useful versions to the users.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Conquering the 5 Biggest Challenges of Requirements Management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/conquering-the-5-biggest-challenges-of-requirements-management-part-i/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "When to Perform a Baseline", "level": 3, "content": "Business analysts sometimes struggle with exactly when to define a requirements baseline. It\u2019s an important decision because establishing the baseline has the following implications:\n\n**Formal change control begins.**\u00a0Change requests are made against an established baseline. The baseline. therefore, provides the point of reference for each proposed change. Make sure your change control process and players are in place before you define any project baselines.\n\n**Project managers determine the staffing levels and budgets needed.\u00a0**There are five dimensions to a software project that must be managed: features, quality, schedule, staff, and budget. Once the features and quality goals are defined in the baseline, the project manager adjusts the other three dimensions to accomplish the project\u2019s objectives. It can work the other way, too. If staff, budget, and/or schedule are pre-established by external forces, the baseline composition is necessarily constrained to fit inside the project box bounded by those limits.\n\n**Project managers make schedule commitments.**\u00a0Prior to baselining, requirements are still volatile and uncertain, so estimates are similarly volatile and uncertain. Once a baseline is established, the contents of the release should be sufficiently well understood so that managers can make realistically achievable commitments. The managers still need to anticipate requirements\u2019 growth (per their requirements management plan) by including sensible contingency buffers in their committed schedules.\n\nBaselining requirements too early can push your change process into overdrive. In fact, receiving a storm of change requests after defining a baseline could be a clue that your requirements elicitation activities were incomplete and perhaps ineffective. On the other hand, waiting too long to establish a baseline could be a sign of analysis paralysis:\u00a0 perhaps the BA is trying too hard to perfect the set of requirements before handing them to the development team.\n\nKeep in mind that requirements elicitation attempts to define a set of requirements that is\u00a0*good enough\u00a0*to let the team proceed with construction at an acceptable level of risk. Use the checklist in Table 1 to judge when you\u2019re ready to define a requirements baseline as a solid foundation for continuing the development effort.\n\nTable 1. Factors to Consider Before Defining a Requirements Baseline\n\nYou\u2019re never going to get perfect, complete requirements. The BA and project manager must judge whether the requirements are converging toward a product description that will satisfy some defined portion of customer needs and is achievable within the known project constraints.\n\nEstablishing a baseline at that point establishes a mutual agreement and expectation among the project stakeholders regarding the product they\u2019re going to have when they\u2019re done. Without such an agreed-upon baseline, there\u2019s a good chance someone will be surprised by the outcome of the project.\n\nAnd [software surprises are rarely good news](https://brainhub.eu/library/cost-of-quality-in-software-development/).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "In This Webinar, Learn How Working with Baselines Benefit Product Development", "level": 3, "content": "**A Baseline Is** an approved version of items such as Requirements, Tests, etc.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Book a Demo", "level": 3, "content": "MktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;

The concepts sound similar, but there are major differences. Features and functionality are the main focus of the product scope. The work that needs to be completed to deliver on the product scope is the focus of the project scope.\n\nProduct scope: features and functionality of the product\n\nImagine a project that is focused on building a new software application. The product scope is to create a new workflow application that meets the requirements of the internal and external stakeholders. Project scope management will ensure the work gets done accurately, on time and without potential miscommunication.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Complete Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-complete-guide-to-the-systems-engineering-body-of-knowledge-sebok)\n\n### Scope Management: What is Scope Creep?\n\nProjects can get bloated with extra tasks that weren\u2019t included in the initial discussions. Project scope management clearly defines what is and what is not included in the project.\n\nA natural control mechanism is created that helps if a client decides to add tasks to the project that weren\u2019t included upfront. Customers won\u2019t always understand why the work isn\u2019t in scope if you can\u2019t refer them to the initial approved document.\n\nFor example, a customer might decide they want to include an online tutorial to help users with a new learning system. This expands the scope of the project and adds more work for your team. Investing time in project scope management will protect you from scope creep and make sure your team gets paid more if work is added to the project.\n\n### How are project scope and project requirements different?\n\nThe project scope defines the specific work that needs to be completed. Project requirements are focused on the specific items that should or should not be included in the project. What does the user want from the product? The answer to this question will shape the project requirements.\n\nA carpenter requires the ability to drill holes that are two inches deep. Accomplishing this requires the carpenter to have a drill bit that is capable of drilling two-inch-long holes.\n\nThe scoping of the project is focused on the materials and processes that go into creating the drill bit that is able to drill a two-inch-deep hole. Typically, requirements are scoped during each phase of a project rollout.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What is Requirements Engineering? An Overview and Intro into Requirements Engineering](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-gathering-and-management-processes/requirements-engineering)\n\n### What is involved in Project Scope Management?\n\nA project scope management plan will help you proactively avoid scope creep and ensure that your customer receives the outcome they expect. This process includes involving key stakeholders in the conversation early to get a clear definition of the project and what is and isn\u2019t included. There are several important aspects of scope management, which include:\n\n- **Kick off the scope management process.**\u00a0Who are the key stakeholders for the project? Define these stakeholders upfront, and set expectations for what to expect and what will be required of the client.\n- **Define the necessary requirements.**\u00a0This is an information-gathering stage. Hold interviews with stakeholders, take surveys and begin a deep dive into what\u2019s required to make the project a success in the eyes of the customer.\n- **Create a project scope statement.**\u00a0With research in hand, you can now define project scope. This definition is important because it\u2019s the backbone of all upcoming project activities and will serve as a guide during the project. A project manager should be able to look at it and determine what is included in a scope. For example, if an additional request comes up, the project manager can ask \u201cWhat is the project scope?\u201d and \u201cDoes this task fit into that scope?\u201d\n- **Seek approval of the scope of a project.**\u00a0It\u2019s critical to have the customer\u2019s formal approval of the project scope. If scope creep happens in the future, you can redirect the client to the agreement and figure out the best way forward.\n- **Define the work breakdown structure (WBS).\u00a0**Everyone knows that if you\u2019re completing a large project, you need to break it down into small pieces. The WBS is where this happens. You are clearly defining the deliverables at each turn in the project.\n- **Validate the project scope.\u00a0**A project manager needs to continually check to ensure the scope of the project is being controlled. This may include matching performance reports to project requirements to identify any potential gaps. And if changes are required, it could include going back to the initial agreement to determine if those fit within the scope of project or a change order is required. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the deliverable is completed on time and within budget.\n\nMost people have heard the expression \u201cmeasure twice, cut once,\u201d and that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing during project scope management. The project scope management process is time-consuming, but investing at this stage of the project has the potential to save you time, money and frustration in the future. Everyone understands what work is required upfront, and they can easily stay focused on the final delivery.\n\n### Accommodating increases in scope\n\nThere will be times when the customer wants to add work. The scope will make it clear the work is outside the original agreement, but you can still accommodate those requests with a few strategies:\n\n- Define functions with lower priority or less time sensitivity than were planned for the current release in order to create room for scope additions.\n- Bring on more development staff to handle the additional tasks and reach your target launch date.\n- Outsource some of the work to meet the client\u2019s deadline.\n- Extend the schedule for the current release to accommodate the requested additions to the project functionality.\n\nIf you\u2019ve done a thorough job during project scope management, it will be clear that the client will need to pay more to accommodate the request. But you can still keep the customer happy by staying agile to meet their deadline or making other accommodations.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How Long Do Requirements Take?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-gathering-and-management-processes/how-long-do-requirements-take)\n\n### Avoiding common Scope Management pitfalls\n\nIf you want to improve project scope management, it helps to understand common pitfalls. There are mistakes that many companies make that transform happy customers into frustrated and confused customers. Consider these common pitfalls when creating scope management documentation:\n\n- **Work that is not clearly defined.**\u00a0Ambiguity is not your friend in the area of scope management. A lack of clarity opens the door to confusion and the prospect of completing unnecessary work. Clearly define the scope and leave no room for misinterpretation.\n- **An incomplete scope.**\u00a0The scope should include all critical elements of a project. No area is too small to include, because if the scope is incomplete, the potential cost is high.\n- **A lack of collaboration.**\u00a0Stakeholders are a critical part of scope management because they are the ones who clearly define project requirements. Make sure that no key stakeholders are left out of the process or, worse, added later, when the project scope has already been defined.\n- **A lack of formal approval of the scope.** All stakeholders need to formally approve the project scope. Securing buy-in keeps you on track and helps you anticipate potential challenges before you\u2019re underwater in project tasks.\n\nUnderstanding potential pitfalls upfront will assist with successfully navigating the scope management process. But it\u2019s also important to periodically evaluate your technology tools and ask whether there are tools available that could help you manage projects more effectively. Many technologies can help you streamline projects and gain greater efficiency.\n\n**Tools and software that help manage project scope**\n\nTechnologies and tools can help you build complex products, systems and software to improve cycle times, increase quality, reduce work and mitigate efforts in proving compliance.

Various industry averages have been published to suggest what percentage of a typical project\u2019s effort should be devoted to requirements development, which includes activities such as requirements gathering (also known as requirements elicitation).\n\nData from different benchmarks don\u2019t agree very well, though, and whether these \u201ctypical\u201d projects are similar to your own is questionable.

Table 1 (below) presents some industry benchmark data for the average percentage of total effort and the average schedule time that projects in several different categories devote to requirements elicitation and prototyping (data from Capers Jones\u2019\u00a0\u201c[Software Assessments, Benchmarks, and Best Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Assessments-Benchmarks-Best-Practices/dp/0201485427)\u201d). These benchmarks are for very large projects of 10,000 function points in size (approximately one million lines of code). How similar are your projects to these benchmarks?\n\n![Image](https://static.jamasoftware.com/www/imports/2012/09/Article39Figure11.jpg)\n\nTable 1. Benchmarks for Requirements Work on Large Projects\n\nThere\u2019s another problem with using industry benchmarks such as these. The data doesn\u2019t indicate how successful those projects were or define what \u201csuccess\u201d means for each project. Nor does this data indicate whether the more successful project teams devoted more of their effort to requirements elicitation activities than the less successful teams \u2014 they\u2019re just averages of actual performance.\n\nWhereas typical project teams devote perhaps 10% or less of their effort on things like requirements gathering, investing more has a big payoff, provided the team doesn\u2019t get trapped in analysis paralysis. Contrary to what many people believe, spending more effort in improving your requirements development process can actually accelerate development.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook](https://www.incose.org/products-and-publications/se-handbook)\n\nWhile working on small projects when I was employed at Kodak, my team would typically devote 15%-to-18% of our total effort on requirements activities. We found this investment reduced the amount of post-delivery rework. It\u2019s difficult to link causes and effects with certainty, but I believe the greatest contributing factor to our low maintenance level was the extensive user participation we cultivated.\n\nI can\u2019t tell you how long you should expect to spend on requirements gathering for\u00a0*your*\u00a0next project. However, Figure 1 identifies some of the conditions that can accelerate your requirements process and several other factors that lengthen the time needed for developing effective requirements.\n\nFigure 1. Factors that influence the time needed for requirements development.\n\n### Your Own Experience\n\nFor starters, your best bet is to collect some data on how much of your own project effort is spent on requirements gathering. That\u2019ll help you judge how well your requirements development process has worked for you in the past. Use this historical data when estimating the requirements effort needed for future projects. Adjust your initial estimate by using the considerations in Figure 1 to compensate for differences between your next project and the benchmark projects. Consider any additional factors that would influence your own project. You might weight each of the factors shown in Figure 1 on a scale of 0 (no effect) to 5 (major impact). This analysis can help you spot risk factors that could prolong your requirements development work.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the development life cycle that the project is following. Not all the requirements elicitation effort should be allocated to the early stages of the project, as is the case in the sequential or waterfall life cycle (dotted line in Figure 2). Don\u2019t think in terms of a discrete \u201crequirements phase,\u201d but rather about a set of requirements-related activities that span the project\u2019s life cycle. In particular, requirements management will be performed on an ongoing basis once a set of requirements baselines emerge for the System Requirements Specification (SRS) and change requests begin to appear.\n\n![Image](https://static.jamasoftware.com/www/imports/2012/09/Article39Figure3.jpg)\n\nFigure 2. The distribution of requirements effort over time varies for projects that follow different development life cycles.\n\n### Iterative and Incremental Approaches\n\nProjects that follow an agile development approach, such as Scrum, take an incremental approach, rapidly building small portions of the product. This puts potentially useful functionality in the users\u2019 hands quickly so that users can refine their needs and developers can keep up with changing business demands. Agile projects will have frequent but small requirements gathering efforts (solid line in Figure 2).\n\nRather than being front-end loaded as on traditional projects, the requirements effort on an agile project is threaded throughout the project. Initial requirements explorations lead to a backlog of intended functionality of various priorities. When a particular feature or function is allocated to a specific iteration, the team will then refine the requirements for that functionality to whatever level of detail is needed to enable development and testing to proceed with confidence.\n\nMany years ago, one of my software development group\u2019s successful projects took just such an incremental approach. This project released useful functionality to the internal corporate user community every three weeks. The first part of each three-week cycle was spent on project planning, developing, and gathering requirements for that increment. The team did just enough requirements development for that increment, quickly implemented it, and provided new functionality to the users a piece at a time. The users provided feedback on those increments that helped steer the rest of the project toward delivering maximum value.\n\nNot all projects are amenable to such fine-grained incremental delivery. When reengineering an existing application, for instance, the new system needs a critical mass of functionality before users can switch to it. Regardless of how large an increment your team tackles on each project cycle, they need to understand the requirements for that increment to avoid extensive rework of designs, code, and tests.\n\n**Planning Requirements Elicitation**\n\nAs with so many aspects of projects, there\u2019s more to requirements gathering than initially meets the eye. As you\u2019re identifying the tasks your analysts might need to perform, consider whether activities such as the following will be necessary:\n\n- Negotiating commitments with product champions.\n- Holding elicitation workshops and conducting interviews.\n- Reviewing existing documents and products.\n- Preparing, distributing, and analyzing surveys.\n- Creating and evaluating prototypes, analysis models, and other requirements views.\n- Performing feasibility, risk, safety, failure, and hazard analyses.\n- Entering requirements information into a database.\n- Reviewing requirements specifications.\n- Developing test cases from requirements and walking through the test cases.\n- Revising requirements specifications following review or test analysis.\n\nYour team might not perform all these activities on each project, and they might have to do other tasks as part of requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation. Anything you learn about the tasks the analysts actually perform and how long those tasks take will improve your ability to estimate the requirements development effort needed for future projects.\n\n*Jama Software has partnered with Karl Wiegers to share licensed content from his books and articles.

Agile projects will have frequent but small requirements gathering efforts (solid line in Figure 2).\n\nRather than being front-end loaded as on traditional projects, the requirements effort on an agile project is threaded throughout the project. Initial requirements explorations lead to a backlog of intended functionality of various priorities. When a particular feature or function is allocated to a specific iteration, the team will then refine the requirements for that functionality to whatever level of detail is needed to enable development and testing to proceed with confidence.\n\nMany years ago, one of my software development group\u2019s successful projects took just such an incremental approach. This project released useful functionality to the internal corporate user community every three weeks. The first part of each three-week cycle was spent on project planning, developing, and gathering requirements for that increment. The team did just enough requirements development for that increment, quickly implemented it, and provided new functionality to the users a piece at a time. The users provided feedback on those increments that helped steer the rest of the project toward delivering maximum value.\n\nNot all projects are amenable to such fine-grained incremental delivery. When reengineering an existing application, for instance, the new system needs a critical mass of functionality before users can switch to it. Regardless of how large an increment your team tackles on each project cycle, they need to understand the requirements for that increment to avoid extensive rework of designs, code, and tests.\n\n**Planning Requirements Elicitation**\n\nAs with so many aspects of projects, there\u2019s more to requirements gathering than initially meets the eye. As you\u2019re identifying the tasks your analysts might need to perform, consider whether activities such as the following will be necessary:\n\nYour team might not perform all these activities on each project, and they might have to do other tasks as part of requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation. Anything you learn about the tasks the analysts actually perform and how long those tasks take will improve your ability to estimate the requirements development effort needed for future projects.\n\n*Jama Software has partnered with Karl Wiegers to share licensed content from his books and articles.

Implement Centralized Requirement Management and Repositories\n\nA centralized repository houses validated requirements, eliminating silos, and providing easy access. Categorization and tagging aid engineers in filtering project-specific requirements seamlessly.\n\n- **Use Case:** Create common libraries for frequently used compliance requirements.\n- **Pro Tip:** Ensure the repository includes metadata like version history, tags, and applicable use cases.\n\n###### 2. Leverage Synchronization Tools for Real-Time Updates\n\nModern platforms like Jama Connect integrate requirement reuse with built-in synchronization. Synchronization ensures changes propagate instantly across reused items, maintaining traceability.\n\n**Example with Jama Connect: **\n\n- Reuse display requirements linked to verification items. Automatically sync future modifications to retain consistency.\n- Use \u201cSync View\u201d to track any deviations between library components and project implementations.\n\n###### 3. Develop Modular and Scalable Requirements\n\nBreak complex requirements into reusable templates or modules. This ensures teams can adapt modular components to new contexts without requiring full redesigns.\n\n- **Scenario:** Modularize compliance standards (e.g., ISO guidelines) into scalable templates tailored for Agile or waterfall workflows.\n\n###### 4. Compare and Consolidate Variances Across Reused Requirements\n\nVariations will occur in reused requirements, such as formatting differences or functional deviations. Tools like Jama Connect\u2019s \u201cCompare View\u201d make it easy to align libraries while controlling variances.\n\n- **Example in Practice:** During roadmap curations, compare product branch differences with traceability views to audit synchronized requirements against changes.\n\n###### 5. Define Governance Policies for Reusability\n\nDesign and implement approval workflows governing when, how, and who can reuse requirements.\n\nChecklist for better governance:\n\n- Enforce standard naming conventions\n- Validate all updates before propagating changes\n- Assign roles, like \u201cReuse Managers,\u201d to oversee standardization initiatives\n\n###### 6. Reusing Test Cases\n\nReusing test cases is a crucial step in streamlining product development, ensuring efficiency, and maintaining consistency across projects. By leveraging existing test cases, teams can reduce redundant effort, accelerate testing cycles, and improve overall traceability between requirements and verification processes.\n\nChecklist for effective test case reuse:\n\n- Maintain a centralized test case repository\n- Standardize test case formats for uniformity\n- Map test cases to requirements for clear traceability\n- Regularly review and update test cases for relevance\n- Assign ownership for managing and curating reusable test cases\n\n*Is there a tool that supports scalable requirement reuse across multiple products? *\n\nJama Connect\u2019s **Reuse and Synchronization** feature allows teams to build smarter systems while speeding up delivery cycles and reducing rework risks.\n\n###### Key Features:\n\n1. **Copy Requirements and Their Relationships:** Copy entire requirement sets along with associated verifications and tests, preserving traceability.\n2. **Real-Time Synchronization:** Maintain alignment across reused content and original source.\n3. **Parallel Development Support:** Manage variances efficiently during product branching and merging for iterative strengthening.\n4. **Comparison Views for Diagnostics:** Perform audits on reused content consistency.\n5. **Scalability:** Ideal for both startups and large enterprises scaling their development projects.\n\n###### Improving Efficiency with Reuse\n\nFrom managing regulatory compliance to accelerating multi-product rollouts, implementing reuse features like Sync View has decreased **requirement review time** by as much as **50%** for Jama Connect users.

It provides forward and backward visibility into all activities surrounding each requirement, including design, development, testing, and support, by keeping track of components, parts, materials, and processes involved in the product\u2019s creation. This documented thread helps minimize the risk of negative outcomes, maximize productivity, and ensure that products meet required specifications and standards. Benefits include greater team efficiency, easier regulatory compliance, and higher-quality products, and it allows for quick identification and resolution of any defects or problems.\n\n![Compact impact analysis](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/03/Complex-Impact-Analysis-with-levels-of-downstream-items-2-1024x534-1.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/write-better-requirements-with-jama-connect-advisor)\n\n### What is the Purpose and Importance of Traceability?\n\n![This image portrays the V Model, which emphasizes the concept of traceability during the stages of product and requirements management.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Group-295-1030x947.png)\n\nTraceability enables product teams to associate a specific requirement with all the related project artifacts, as well as other requirements, both forward and backward, so that anyone can see how the activity relates to the requirement \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 at any point during development. This functionality, also called live traceability, fosters team collaboration and enables early detection of possible production risks.\n\nThink of it this way: How important is it to have your products developed correctly in terms of definition, quality, and timing? Mission critical, right? That\u2019s why requirements traceability is so critical.\n\nTraceability is particularly important in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, where safety, quality, and compliance are critical. In these industries, traceability systems are often mandated by regulatory bodies to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and comply with applicable standards and regulations.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the [benefits of requirements traceability throughout the development process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability/). For example:\n\n- Simplifies project estimates\n- Enhances process visibility\n- Increases development efficiency\n- Improves impact analysis of change\n- Demonstrates verification and validation\n- Strengthens product quality\n- Proves compliance or functional safety\n\nA single line of sight on a requirement, or a [digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), is supremely important for application lifecycle management (ALM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). Both endure tight timelines and increasing numbers of requirements \u2014 including those from regulations, where compliance is non-negotiable.\n\nTraceability is particularly important in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, where safety, quality, and compliance are critical. In these industries, traceable systems are often mandated by regulatory bodies to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and comply with applicable standards and regulations.\n\nKnowing the relationship between requirements, risk, tests, and so forth, is the difference between developing a compliant product on time and getting stuck in rework, delaying launches, and dealing with unhappy stakeholders. With requirements traceability, you don\u2019t have to compromise on speed or quality.\n\nThe bottom line is that end-to-end traceability confirms you\u2019re building the right thing and helps you prove compliance or functional safety. Without it, your development efficiency and product quality are in jeopardy.\n\n### What is a Traceable System?\n\nA traceable product or system is one that has a documented history or record of its development, production, and testing. This record provides a complete picture of the product or system, including its design, components, and any modifications or changes made throughout its development. A traceable system also enables organizations to quickly identify the source of any issues or problems that arise during production or testing, and to take corrective action as needed.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### Forward, backward, and bidirectional: The mechanics of creating a digital thread with traceability\n\nTo connect all the phases of the development process, from customer needs through support, four distinct kinds of links must be used to thread the process end-to-end. This includes high-level requirements as well as derived requirements \u2014 those not specifically defined but necessary for meeting defined requirements or having the system work as expected. Derived requirements must also be adequately traced to reap the full benefits of Live Traceability\u2122.\n\n#### Forward\n\nThere are two kinds of forward traceability: forward to requirements and forward from requirements. They both trace from an upstream component to downstream artifacts. The difference is in where they begin.\n\n**Forward to requirements** traces from customer need to requirements. This is important because customer needs can evolve over time. If they do, requirements may need to change as a result. Following this type of forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes in priorities at any time throughout development.\n\n**Forward from requirements** traces relationships between requirements and corresponding downstream artifacts, including test cases. This type of trace ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.\n\n![Live Traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/traceability-hub-icon-sm.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/forward-traceability.webp)\n\n#### Backward\n\nLike forward, there are two kinds of backward traceability. This pair traces from an endpoint, or downstream work product, to upstream elements. These two types have differing starting points.\n\n**Backward from requirements** gives insight on how a requirement came to be by linking the requirement to the customer use case it addresses. This enables teams to improve decision making by understanding the origin of a requirement.\n\n**Backward to requirements** begins at performed work and traces to its requirement. It gives visibility into why specific items were created and how different pieces of a system fit together. Tracing in this way also allows testers to find gaps or missing requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Achieve Live Traceability\u2122 with Jira\u00ae for Software Development Teams](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/how-to-achieve-live-traceability-with-jira-for-software-development-teams)\n\n#### Bidirectional\n\nBidirectional requirements traceability is the ability to perform both forward and backward traceability. Bidirectional is optimal because it gives teams full visibility from requirements specifications through building, testing, changes, defects, and back again. Traceability of this caliber can only be achieved through automated requirements management tools, such as Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/bidirectional-traceability.webp)\n\n### What Are the Benefits of Traceability?\n\nThe benefits of traceability are many. First, it ensures product quality by enabling organizations to track and verify that all components and processes meet the required standards and specifications. This helps to reduce the risk of defects and recalls, which can be costly in terms of both financial losses and damage to a company\u2019s reputation.\n\nSecond, traceability helps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In many industries, organizations are required to maintain detailed records of their products and processes and to demonstrate that they are meeting all applicable standards and regulations. A traceable system provides a way to easily produce these records and demonstrate compliance.\n\nThird, it promotes accountability and transparency. By maintaining a complete record of a product\u2019s development and testing, organizations can demonstrate that they are taking steps to ensure quality and safety. This can help to build trust with customers and stakeholders and enhance a company\u2019s reputation.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Accelerate, Measure, and Improve the Systems Development Process with Live Traceability\u2122 in Jama Connect\u00ae](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/demo/accelerate-measure-and-improve-the-systems-development-process-with-live-traceability-in-jama-connect)\n\n### How Do You Enable Traceability?\n\nIn practice, traceability involves the use of tools and systems to track and document the various components and processes involved in product development and testing. These tools can range from simple spreadsheets and databases to modern requirements management platforms that generate [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability) that integrate with other [product development tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/integrations/) such as product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, test management tools, and task management tools like Atlassian Jira and Azure DevOps.\n\n### Challenges in Implementing Traceability\n\nOne of the key challenges in implementing traceability is ensuring that all relevant data is captured and documented. This can be particularly difficult in complex product development processes involving multiple teams, suppliers, and partners. However, by establishing clear processes and standards for data capture and documentation, organizations can overcome these challenges and reap the benefits of traceability.\n\nIn conclusion, traceability is a critical aspect of product and system development that enables organizations to ensure product quality, compliance, and accountability. By maintaining a complete record of a product\u2019s development and testing, organizations can reduce the risk of defects and recalls, demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements, and build trust with customers and stakeholders. While implementing a traceability system manually is very challenging, using a modern platform like Jama Connect automatically creates Live Traceability throughout the development process.\n\n*Note: This article was partially drafted with the aid of AI.

This \u201ctrace-ability\u201d enhances project visibility, streamlines collaboration, and simplifies compliance with industry standards. But what exactly does \u201ctraceable\u201d mean?\n\nTo define trackable, it involves the ability to monitor and verify requirements through every stage of the development lifecycle. In other words, traceability ensures that requirements are not just documented but also consistently \u201ctraced\u201d to corresponding deliverables, including design elements, test cases, and risk assessments. The traced meaning goes beyond simple documentation\u2014it\u2019s about creating a live, dynamic connection between project artifacts.\n\n### What is Compliance Traceability?\n\nFor organizations operating in regulated industries, compliance traceability is vital for adhering to standards such as [ISO 26262](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/automotive-engineering/iso-26262-and-recent-updates-ensuring-functional-safety-in-the-automotive-industry), DO-178C, FDA [Design Controls](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/medical-devices/design-history-file-dhf), and others. By leveraging requirements traceability software, teams can ensure that all requirements meet regulatory mandates, reducing the risk of costly non-compliance or project delays.\n\nModern traceability tools provide powerful capabilities to define, track, and manage these connections. These tools make it easier to answer critical questions during audits, such as:\n\n- Which requirement is linked to a specific test case?\n- What is the status of risk assessments associated with each requirement?\n- How do design changes impact downstream deliverables?\n\n### Why Use Requirements Traceability Software?\n\nThe evolution of requirement tracing tools has redefined how teams manage complex projects. Modern software enables teams to achieve live traceability, where all relationships between requirements and project elements are automatically updated as changes occur. With the right software tracing tools, teams can save time, minimize errors, and improve collaboration.\n\nKey benefits of requirements traceability software include:\n\n- Real-time insights into project progress and risk.\n- Simplified compliance reporting with audit-ready documentation.\n- Streamlined workflows that connect cross-functional teams.\n\n### Traceable Definition in Modern Requirements Management\n\nWhen you trace define requirements in a project, you\u2019re establishing a roadmap to connect all related elements\u2014from initial stakeholder needs to final deliverables. A traceable definition incorporates several elements:\n\n- **Identifiable:** Each requirement must be uniquely defined and accessible.\n- **Linked:** Requirements must be \u201ctraced\u201d to other relevant artifacts, such as test cases or risks.\n- **Verified:** The trace must be validated through testing and other means to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn this context, traceability tools are indispensable for meeting project goals and maintaining quality.\n\n### The Role of Traceability in Driving Innovation\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive landscape, effective traceability isn\u2019t just a compliance measure\u2014it\u2019s a strategic advantage. When teams use the best requirement tracing tools, they can better manage complexity, identify potential risks early, and deliver higher-quality products faster.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing traceability practices with advanced tools can transform how your organization operates, setting the stage for greater innovation, efficiency, and success.\n\n*Editors note: This article was partially drafted with the assistance of AI and reviewed for accuracy by McKenzie Jonsson.*\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn How Jama Connect\u00ae Helps Maintain Live Traceability\u2122 Across Applications.\n\nTHE DEFINITION\n\n**Requirements Traceability:** is the tracking of requirements throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\nPREVIOUSRequirements Traceability\n\nNEXT UPTracing Your Way to Success: The Crucial Role of Traceability in Modern Product and Systems Development\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

Systems engineers frequently grapple with several key pain points:\n\n- **Poorly Defined or Evolving Requirements:** When requirements are ambiguous or change frequently without a formal process, traceability links break. This creates gaps in coverage, leading to features that don\u2019t meet stakeholder needs.\n- **Inefficient Communication and Collaboration:** Development teams often work in silos with their own specialized tools. Without a unified platform, tracking dependencies between hardware, software, and testing teams becomes a manual, error-prone effort.\n- **Budget and Schedule Overruns:** The inability to perform accurate impact analysis is a major consequence of poor traceability. A seemingly small change can have unforeseen ripple effects, causing significant rework that delays timelines and inflates budgets.\n- **Post-Delivery Issues and Maintenance:** When a defect is found after a product is released, a lack of traceability makes it incredibly difficult to pinpoint the root cause. This extends resolution times and complicates maintenance.\n- **Integration and Scalability Challenges:** As projects grow in complexity, manual traceability methods, like spreadsheets, quickly become unmanageable. They cannot scale to handle thousands of requirements and artifacts across multiple product variants.\n\n![Why is Achieving Traceability a Challenge for Systems Engineers?  This image of a bucket leaking water lists out those challenges.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/09/1-achieve-lt-1-1030x863.png)\n\n### Core Methods for Achieving Requirements Traceability\n\nTo overcome these challenges, it\u2019s crucial to understand the fundamental methods that form the basis of a strong traceability strategy. [The goal is to create a digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/unraveling-the-digital-thread-enhancing-connectivity-and-efficiency/) \u2014 a single, authoritative source of truth that connects every piece of data across the product lifecycle.\n\n#### Forward, Backward, and Bidirectional Traceability\n\nTraceability is not a one-way street. It requires looking at relationships from different perspectives to gain full visibility.\n\n- **Forward Traceability:** This involves tracing from an upstream artifact to a downstream one. For example, linking a stakeholder requirement to the functional requirements, design specifications, and test cases created to fulfill it. **This ensures that every requirement is implemented and tested.**\n- **Backward Traceability:** This traces from a downstream artifact back to its origin. For instance, linking a test case back to the specific requirement it is meant to verify. This is crucial for understanding the \u201cwhy\u201d behind a particular design choice or test and **ensuring no \u201corphan\u201d components exist without a clear purpose.**\n- **Bidirectional Traceability:** This is the combination of forward and backward traceability, creating a complete, two-way view of relationships. The key takeaway: Bidirectional traceability is the gold standard, as it enables comprehensive impact analysis. When a requirement changes, you can instantly see all connected design elements, tests, and risks, and vice versa.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### How-To: 5 Steps to Implement Traceability in Your Projects\n\nAchieving robust traceability requires a structured approach. Follow these actionable steps to build a scalable and effective process.\n\n#### Step 1: Define Your Traceability Information Model (TIM)\n\nBefore you start linking artifacts, you must define what needs to be connected. Your TIM is a blueprint that outlines the relationships between different item types (e.g., stakeholder requirements, system requirements, risks, test cases, software components). This model should align with your development process and any industry standards you must adhere to.\n\n#### Step 2: Select the Right Tools\n\nMany teams start with spreadsheets to create a [requirements traceability matrix (RTM)](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/how-to-create-and-use-a-requirements-traceability-matrix/), but this approach is not a sustainable solution. Manual methods are prone to human error, difficult to maintain, and do not provide real-time visibility. Modern requirements management platforms are designed to automate this process.\n\n#### Step 3: Centralize All Requirements\n\nA single source of truth is non-negotiable for effective traceability. Consolidate all requirements from various documents, emails, and spreadsheets into a centralized platform. This ensures everyone is working from the most current information and prevents discrepancies caused by outdated or conflicting sources.\n\n#### Step 4: Integrate Your Engineering Toolchain\n\nYour requirements management platform should not be another silo. Integrate it with other best-of-breed tools used by your engineering teams, such as Jira for task management, test automation tools, and PLM systems. This creates a seamless digital thread across the entire development ecosystem.\n\n#### Step 5: Automate and Maintain Live Traceability\u2122\n\nTraceability is not a one-time activity performed at the end of a phase. It must be a continuous, \u201clive\u201d process. The most important aspect is to use a system that automatically maintains traceability links as changes occur. This concept, known as [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/live-traceability-vs-after-the-fact-traceability/), provides real-time visibility into project health, coverage, and risk.\n\n![5 Steps to Implement Traceability in Your Projects ](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/09/2-achieve-lt-1-1008x1030.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Achieve Live Traceability\u2122 with Jira\u00ae for Software Development Teams](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/how-to-achieve-live-traceability-with-jira-for-software-development-teams)\n\n### The Role of Tools in Achieving Traceability\n\nWhile process is critical, the right tooling is what makes modern traceability achievable at scale.

This \u201ctrace-ability\u201d enhances project visibility, streamlines collaboration, and simplifies compliance with industry standards. But what exactly does \u201ctraceable\u201d mean?\n\nTo define trackable, it involves the ability to monitor and verify requirements through every stage of the development lifecycle. In other words, traceability ensures that requirements are not just documented but also consistently \u201ctraced\u201d to corresponding deliverables, including design elements, test cases, and risk assessments. The traced meaning goes beyond simple documentation\u2014it\u2019s about creating a live, dynamic connection between project artifacts.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/write-better-requirements-with-jama-connect-advisor)\n\n### What is Compliance Traceability?\n\nFor organizations operating in regulated industries, compliance traceability is vital for adhering to standards such as [ISO 26262](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/automotive-engineering/iso-26262-and-recent-updates-ensuring-functional-safety-in-the-automotive-industry), DO-178C, FDA [Design Controls](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/medical-devices/design-history-file-dhf), and others. By leveraging requirements traceability software, teams can ensure that all requirements meet regulatory mandates, reducing the risk of costly non-compliance or project delays.\n\nModern traceability tools provide powerful capabilities to define, track, and manage these connections. These tools make it easier to answer critical questions during audits, such as:\n\n- Which requirement is linked to a specific test case?\n- What is the status of risk assessments associated with each requirement?\n- How do design changes impact downstream deliverables?\n\n### Why Use Requirements Traceability Software?\n\nThe evolution of requirement tracing tools has redefined how teams manage complex projects. Modern software enables teams to achieve live traceability, where all relationships between requirements and project elements are automatically updated as changes occur. With the right software tracing tools, teams can save time, minimize errors, and improve collaboration.\n\nKey benefits of requirements traceability software include:\n\n- Real-time insights into project progress and risk.\n- Simplified compliance reporting with audit-ready documentation.\n- Streamlined workflows that connect cross-functional teams.\n\n### Traceable Definition in Modern Requirements Management\n\nWhen you trace define requirements in a project, you\u2019re establishing a roadmap to connect all related elements\u2014from initial stakeholder needs to final deliverables. A traceable definition incorporates several elements:\n\n- **Identifiable:** Each requirement must be uniquely defined and accessible.\n- **Linked:** Requirements must be \u201ctraced\u201d to other relevant artifacts, such as test cases or risks.\n- **Verified:** The trace must be validated through testing and other means to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn this context, traceability tools are indispensable for meeting project goals and maintaining quality.\n\n### The Role of Traceability in Driving Innovation\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive landscape, effective traceability isn\u2019t just a compliance measure\u2014it\u2019s a strategic advantage. When teams use the best requirement tracing tools, they can better manage complexity, identify potential risks early, and deliver higher-quality products faster.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing traceability practices with advanced tools can transform how your organization operates, setting the stage for greater innovation, efficiency, and success.\n\n*Editors note: This article was partially drafted with the assistance of AI and reviewed for accuracy by McKenzie Jonsson.*\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn How Jama Connect\u00ae Helps Maintain Live Traceability\u2122 Across Applications.\n\nTHE DEFINITION\n\n**Requirements Traceability:** is the tracking of requirements throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\nPREVIOUSGuide to Poor Requirements: Identify Causes, Repercussions, and How to Fix Them\n\nNEXT UPCan You Track Requirements in Jira?\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

It provides forward and backward visibility into all activities surrounding each requirement, including design, development, testing, and support, by keeping track of components, parts, materials, and processes involved in the product\u2019s creation. This documented thread helps minimize the risk of negative outcomes, maximize productivity, and ensure that products meet required specifications and standards. Benefits include greater team efficiency, easier regulatory compliance, and higher-quality products, and it allows for quick identification and resolution of any defects or problems.\n\n![Compact impact analysis](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/03/Complex-Impact-Analysis-with-levels-of-downstream-items-2-1024x534-1.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/write-better-requirements-with-jama-connect-advisor)\n\n### What is the Purpose and Importance of Traceability?\n\n![This image portrays the V Model, which emphasizes the concept of traceability during the stages of product and requirements management.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Group-295-1030x947.png)\n\nTraceability enables product teams to associate a specific requirement with all the related project artifacts, as well as other requirements, both forward and backward, so that anyone can see how the activity relates to the requirement \u2014 and vice versa \u2014 at any point during development. This functionality, also called live traceability, fosters team collaboration and enables early detection of possible production risks.\n\nThink of it this way: How important is it to have your products developed correctly in terms of definition, quality, and timing? Mission critical, right? That\u2019s why requirements traceability is so critical.\n\nTraceability is particularly important in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, where safety, quality, and compliance are critical. In these industries, traceability systems are often mandated by regulatory bodies to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and comply with applicable standards and regulations.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the [benefits of requirements traceability throughout the development process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability/). For example:\n\n- Simplifies project estimates\n- Enhances process visibility\n- Increases development efficiency\n- Improves impact analysis of change\n- Demonstrates verification and validation\n- Strengthens product quality\n- Proves compliance or functional safety\n\nA single line of sight on a requirement, or a [digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), is supremely important for application lifecycle management (ALM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). Both endure tight timelines and increasing numbers of requirements \u2014 including those from regulations, where compliance is non-negotiable.\n\nTraceability is particularly important in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical devices, where safety, quality, and compliance are critical. In these industries, traceable systems are often mandated by regulatory bodies to ensure that products are safe, reliable, and comply with applicable standards and regulations.\n\nKnowing the relationship between requirements, risk, tests, and so forth, is the difference between developing a compliant product on time and getting stuck in rework, delaying launches, and dealing with unhappy stakeholders. With requirements traceability, you don\u2019t have to compromise on speed or quality.\n\nThe bottom line is that end-to-end traceability confirms you\u2019re building the right thing and helps you prove compliance or functional safety. Without it, your development efficiency and product quality are in jeopardy.\n\n### What is a Traceable System?\n\nA traceable product or system is one that has a documented history or record of its development, production, and testing. This record provides a complete picture of the product or system, including its design, components, and any modifications or changes made throughout its development. A traceable system also enables organizations to quickly identify the source of any issues or problems that arise during production or testing, and to take corrective action as needed.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### Forward, backward, and bidirectional: The mechanics of creating a digital thread with traceability\n\nTo connect all the phases of the development process, from customer needs through support, four distinct kinds of links must be used to thread the process end-to-end. This includes high-level requirements as well as derived requirements \u2014 those not specifically defined but necessary for meeting defined requirements or having the system work as expected. Derived requirements must also be adequately traced to reap the full benefits of Live Traceability\u2122.\n\n#### Forward\n\nThere are two kinds of forward traceability: forward to requirements and forward from requirements. They both trace from an upstream component to downstream artifacts. The difference is in where they begin.\n\n**Forward to requirements** traces from customer need to requirements. This is important because customer needs can evolve over time. If they do, requirements may need to change as a result. Following this type of forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes in priorities at any time throughout development.\n\n**Forward from requirements** traces relationships between requirements and corresponding downstream artifacts, including test cases. This type of trace ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.\n\n![Live Traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/traceability-hub-icon-sm.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/forward-traceability.webp)\n\n#### Backward\n\nLike forward, there are two kinds of backward traceability. This pair traces from an endpoint, or downstream work product, to upstream elements. These two types have differing starting points.\n\n**Backward from requirements** gives insight on how a requirement came to be by linking the requirement to the customer use case it addresses. This enables teams to improve decision making by understanding the origin of a requirement.\n\n**Backward to requirements** begins at performed work and traces to its requirement. It gives visibility into why specific items were created and how different pieces of a system fit together. Tracing in this way also allows testers to find gaps or missing requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Achieve Live Traceability\u2122 with Jira\u00ae for Software Development Teams](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/how-to-achieve-live-traceability-with-jira-for-software-development-teams)\n\n#### Bidirectional\n\nBidirectional requirements traceability is the ability to perform both forward and backward traceability. Bidirectional is optimal because it gives teams full visibility from requirements specifications through building, testing, changes, defects, and back again. Traceability of this caliber can only be achieved through automated requirements management tools, such as Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/bidirectional-traceability.webp)\n\n### What Are the Benefits of Traceability?\n\nThe benefits of traceability are many. First, it ensures product quality by enabling organizations to track and verify that all components and processes meet the required standards and specifications. This helps to reduce the risk of defects and recalls, which can be costly in terms of both financial losses and damage to a company\u2019s reputation.\n\nSecond, traceability helps to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. In many industries, organizations are required to maintain detailed records of their products and processes and to demonstrate that they are meeting all applicable standards and regulations. A traceable system provides a way to easily produce these records and demonstrate compliance.\n\nThird, it promotes accountability and transparency. By maintaining a complete record of a product\u2019s development and testing, organizations can demonstrate that they are taking steps to ensure quality and safety. This can help to build trust with customers and stakeholders and enhance a company\u2019s reputation.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Accelerate, Measure, and Improve the Systems Development Process with Live Traceability\u2122 in Jama Connect\u00ae](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/demo/accelerate-measure-and-improve-the-systems-development-process-with-live-traceability-in-jama-connect)\n\n### How Do You Enable Traceability?\n\nIn practice, traceability involves the use of tools and systems to track and document the various components and processes involved in product development and testing. These tools can range from simple spreadsheets and databases to modern requirements management platforms that generate [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability) that integrate with other [product development tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/integrations/) such as product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, test management tools, and task management tools like Atlassian Jira and Azure DevOps.\n\n### Challenges in Implementing Traceability\n\nOne of the key challenges in implementing traceability is ensuring that all relevant data is captured and documented. This can be particularly difficult in complex product development processes involving multiple teams, suppliers, and partners. However, by establishing clear processes and standards for data capture and documentation, organizations can overcome these challenges and reap the benefits of traceability.\n\nIn conclusion, traceability is a critical aspect of product and system development that enables organizations to ensure product quality, compliance, and accountability. By maintaining a complete record of a product\u2019s development and testing, organizations can reduce the risk of defects and recalls, demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements, and build trust with customers and stakeholders. While implementing a traceability system manually is very challenging, using a modern platform like Jama Connect automatically creates Live Traceability throughout the development process.\n\n*Note: This article was partially drafted with the aid of AI.

This \u201ctrace-ability\u201d enhances project visibility, streamlines collaboration, and simplifies compliance with industry standards. But what exactly does \u201ctraceable\u201d mean?\n\nTo define trackable, it involves the ability to monitor and verify requirements through every stage of the development lifecycle. In other words, traceability ensures that requirements are not just documented but also consistently \u201ctraced\u201d to corresponding deliverables, including design elements, test cases, and risk assessments. The traced meaning goes beyond simple documentation\u2014it\u2019s about creating a live, dynamic connection between project artifacts.\n\n### What is Compliance Traceability?\n\nFor organizations operating in regulated industries, compliance traceability is vital for adhering to standards such as [ISO 26262](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/automotive-engineering/iso-26262-and-recent-updates-ensuring-functional-safety-in-the-automotive-industry), DO-178C, FDA [Design Controls](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/medical-devices/design-history-file-dhf), and others. By leveraging requirements traceability software, teams can ensure that all requirements meet regulatory mandates, reducing the risk of costly non-compliance or project delays.\n\nModern traceability tools provide powerful capabilities to define, track, and manage these connections. These tools make it easier to answer critical questions during audits, such as:\n\n- Which requirement is linked to a specific test case?\n- What is the status of risk assessments associated with each requirement?\n- How do design changes impact downstream deliverables?\n\n### Why Use Requirements Traceability Software?\n\nThe evolution of requirement tracing tools has redefined how teams manage complex projects. Modern software enables teams to achieve live traceability, where all relationships between requirements and project elements are automatically updated as changes occur. With the right software tracing tools, teams can save time, minimize errors, and improve collaboration.\n\nKey benefits of requirements traceability software include:\n\n- Real-time insights into project progress and risk.\n- Simplified compliance reporting with audit-ready documentation.\n- Streamlined workflows that connect cross-functional teams.\n\n### Traceable Definition in Modern Requirements Management\n\nWhen you trace define requirements in a project, you\u2019re establishing a roadmap to connect all related elements\u2014from initial stakeholder needs to final deliverables. A traceable definition incorporates several elements:\n\n- **Identifiable:** Each requirement must be uniquely defined and accessible.\n- **Linked:** Requirements must be \u201ctraced\u201d to other relevant artifacts, such as test cases or risks.\n- **Verified:** The trace must be validated through testing and other means to ensure accuracy.\n\nIn this context, traceability tools are indispensable for meeting project goals and maintaining quality.\n\n### The Role of Traceability in Driving Innovation\n\nIn today\u2019s competitive landscape, effective traceability isn\u2019t just a compliance measure\u2014it\u2019s a strategic advantage. When teams use the best requirement tracing tools, they can better manage complexity, identify potential risks early, and deliver higher-quality products faster.\n\nUnderstanding and implementing traceability practices with advanced tools can transform how your organization operates, setting the stage for greater innovation, efficiency, and success.\n\n*Editors note: This article was partially drafted with the assistance of AI and reviewed for accuracy by McKenzie Jonsson.*\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn How Jama Connect\u00ae Helps Maintain Live Traceability\u2122 Across Applications.\n\nTHE DEFINITION\n\n**Requirements Traceability:** is the tracking of requirements throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\nPREVIOUSRequirements Traceability\n\nNEXT UPTracing Your Way to Success: The Crucial Role of Traceability in Modern Product and Systems Development\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

However, implementing changes without a proper understanding of their potential impact can lead to disruptions, delays, and costly mistakes. This is where Change Impact Analysis (CIA) becomes crucial. In this article, we will explore the concept of Change Impact Analysis and its significance in managing organizational transformations. Additionally, we will delve into three related topics: Change Management, Risk Assessment, and Stakeholder Engagement, to provide a holistic perspective on the topic.\n\n### Change Impact Analysis (CIA):\n\nChange Impact Analysis refers to the systematic process of evaluating and predicting the consequences that changes can have on various aspects of a project. It involves identifying the scope, magnitude, and implications of proposed changes before implementation. By conducting a thorough CIA, businesses can make informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and mitigate potential risks. Moreover, CIA enables organizations to optimize change management strategies and minimize disruptions to ongoing operations.\n\n- **Methodology and Steps in Change Impact Analysis:** Change Impact Analysis involves a systematic approach to assessing the potential effects of changes on an organization. The process typically begins by identifying the proposed changes, whether they involve implementing new technologies, modifying business processes, or restructuring organizational hierarchies. Next, the analysis focuses on determining the scope and scale of the changes, considering factors such as the number of departments or individuals affected, the magnitude of system modifications, and the interdependencies between different components. Through data gathering, interviews, and collaboration with subject matter experts, the analysis identifies potential risks, dependencies, and areas of impact. This information is then synthesized to produce an impact assessment report, outlining the predicted consequences and recommended mitigation strategies.\n- **Key Benefits of Change Impact Analysis:** Implementing Change Impact Analysis brings numerous benefits to organizations undergoing transformations. Firstly, it provides valuable insights into the potential risks and challenges associated with proposed changes, enabling organizations to proactively address them. This reduces the likelihood of unexpected disruptions and minimizes the negative impact on business operations. Secondly, CIA helps optimize resource allocation by identifying the areas that require the most attention and resources during the change implementation process. By focusing efforts on high-impact areas, organizations can allocate resources efficiently, leading to cost savings and improved project outcomes. Lastly, Change Impact Analysis supports decision-making by providing objective and data-driven information about the potential consequences of changes. This empowers stakeholders to make informed choices, adapt implementation plans, and align strategies with the organization\u2019s goals and objectives.\n- **Tools and Techniques for Change Impact Analysis:** To facilitate Change Impact Analysis, organizations can utilize various tools and techniques. One commonly used approach is conducting interviews and workshops with key stakeholders and subject matter experts to gather insights, perspectives, and knowledge about the organization\u2019s processes, systems, and dependencies.

Why Does It Matter for Product Teams?\n\n![This graphic depicts Live Traceability, a way to enhance Requirements Traceability.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Live-Traceability-on-Light.png)\n\nProduct complexity is growing at an exponential rate. As it does, requirements move between more and more departments and stakeholders throughout the course of the development process. Traceability helps product teams overcome one of the biggest challenges they face with [requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/).\n\nThe number of decision points is higher than it\u2019s ever been. Each decision needs to be made understanding the impact on the requirement itself and on the product overall. It is essential to maintain visibility into the activity taking place and to be able to tie it all together.\n\nThat\u2019s where requirements traceability comes in. What follows is a look at the definition of requirements traceability, as well as its purpose, importance, benefits, and challenges.\n\n### Common challenges\n\nIf all this sounds like traceability is too difficult, fear not. While there are[\u00a0some challenges to requirements traceability](https://web.archive.org/web/20180426111911/http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/702523/9188499/1288392919397/200907-Kannenberg.pdf?token=qsyKOWaIHYcXMnQDPg1NnxqYPa0%3D), there are also many templates and tools you can use to streamline the process (more on that below). For now, let\u2019s tackle some of the challenges so you can see how they can be overcome.\n\n##### Differing organizational viewpoints.\n\nNot everyone has the same understanding of why and how traceability should be performed. Stakeholders in sponsor or management positions may only view requirements traceability from a standard or regulatory perspective. They see it as a \u201cmust-have\u201d but may not understand the additional benefits of requirements traceability (as discussed above) in the way a project or systems engineer might.\n\nOne way to tackle this obstacle is to educate stakeholders on what can be achieved if end-to-end traceability is achieved. Share this article with everyone involved in your development process so they can have a basic understanding of why requirements traceability is an essential part of requirements management, beyond simply knowing they need it to cover their bases.\n\n##### Organization-wide adoption.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons a company might be slow to adopt traceability. Training is one such example. As considered regarding stakeholders, not all teams or individuals working on a project know why traceability is so crucial, or they simply may not know how to execute proper traceability correctly. Additionally, some people may be worried that traceability data from their decision points could come back to bite them.\n\nIf this is a challenge for your organization, again, education is imperative. But even beyond that, you need to create a culture in which traceability is seen as an inherent part of the development process. Start by creating clear policies regarding how the organization manages traceability. Then develop a positive training program for all new and existing employees to complete. If you choose a requirements management tool, make sure it has a strong track record of being\u00a0[intuitive and easy to use software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-names-jama-connect-winter-2021-leader-alm-software/)\u00a0that adapts to your process\u2014not the other way around.\n\n##### Cost of implementation.\n\nGetting an entire development organization on the same page regarding requirements traceability, then ensuring proper execution, can be a costly endeavor. The time spent developing policies, conducting training, and creating/maintaining traceability data add up and can even make folks feel less productive. Additionally, you may choose to adopt a traceability tool to streamline your process, which means upfront costs will be higher than previous projects.\n\nOvercoming this obstacle requires a mindset change. We urge you to consider the cost of doing nothing. Unproductive work time, lengthy time-to-market, rework, and defects are all extremely expensive symptoms of inadequate requirements traceability. Each of these carries a hefty price tag. For a look at exactly how much these complications could be costing your organization, check out the\u00a0[calculators on pages 9-11 in our Buyer\u2019s Guide](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tool). While there are costs to implementing requirements traceability and management tools, the amount saved throughout the development process far outweighs the short-term investment.\n\n##### Managing change.\n\nWhen building complex products, change is inevitable. It is essential that team members know about the changes and scope their impact across the product development lifecycle. That means looking closely at any related system requirements, downstream requirements, and verification tests that may be affected.\n\nPerforming this activity can be cumbersome and time consuming with manual tools. And the associated risks are similar to doing nothing, simply because you cannot be sure you\u2019ve accounted for everything when dealing with static documents and human error.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced this setback in your organization, it may be time to explore automated requirements management tools that enable [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability).\n\n##### Improper management tools.\n\nSome development teams are still tracing requirement relationships using Word or Excel documents and collaborating via email. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is one example of a document that manually traces elements of requirements management including, business requirements, objectives, design elements, and test cases via a spreadsheet. Teams input the list of requirements and fill in the related data. The spreadsheet is static but is updated manually by the team throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nThere can be advantages to using a RTM if you are developing a product that doesn\u2019t have many requirements. And it is better than not tracing at all. You can even use a template to create an RTM. However, if your product is complex, with many requirements, you\u2019ll likely experience many of the challenges discussed above.\n\nIn the case of complex products, a RTM\u00a0does not have the functionality you\u2019ll need to keep up with the pace of change and create a quality product in the timeframe required by stakeholders.\u00a0[Flexible requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-application-lifecycle-management-tools/)\u00a0like Jama Connect can even capture trace relationships across teams and toolsets, further enhancing the benefits of traceability.\n\n##### Insufficient compliance framework.\n\nRegulated industries need requirements management to demonstrate compliance with industry standards. There are specific ways reviewers and regulators must receive regulatory submissions. To pass an audit you must present proof of comprehensive traceability.\n\nIf comprehensive traceability wasn\u2019t performed throughout your development process, a lot of time will be committed to gathering the necessary information after the fact. Even if traceability was meticulously maintained in Word or Excel, there will still be time spent compiling it into an acceptable format for regulatory submission. In the meantime, competitors that make traceability inherent to their process will be first to market.\n\nSound familiar? Luckily, there are\u00a0[tools that perform end-to-end traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-ways-jama-makes-managing-traceability-easy/)\u00a0and come with frameworks aligned with industry standards.\u00a0[Requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/)\u00a0like Jama Connect simplify the audit process with export templates, thus speeding up the compliance presentation process.\n\n### Templates and tools to streamline the process\n\n![This V Model demonstrates Requirements Traceability in action.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Group-295-1030x947.png)\n\nThere are numerous tools available to assist with the end-to-end traceability process. It\u2019s important to assess your needs to know what is best for you.\n\nAre you creating a straightforward product that doesn\u2019t have functional safety or regulatory requirements? If so, an RTM may suffice. Download this [Requirements Traceability Matrix template](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/03/Requirements_Traceability_Matrix_Template_DRAFT.xlsx)\u00a0to get started today.\n\nAre you creating a multifaceted product with both software and hardware components?

As it does, requirements move between more and more departments and stakeholders throughout the course of the development process. Traceability helps product teams overcome one of the biggest challenges they face with [requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/).\n\nThe number of decision points is higher than it\u2019s ever been. Each decision needs to be made understanding the impact on the requirement itself and on the product overall. It is essential to maintain visibility into the activity taking place and to be able to tie it all together.\n\nThat\u2019s where requirements traceability comes in. What follows is a look at the definition of requirements traceability, as well as its purpose, importance, benefits, and challenges.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Common challenges", "level": 3, "content": "If all this sounds like traceability is too difficult, fear not. While there are[\u00a0some challenges to requirements traceability](https://web.archive.org/web/20180426111911/http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/702523/9188499/1288392919397/200907-Kannenberg.pdf?token=qsyKOWaIHYcXMnQDPg1NnxqYPa0%3D), there are also many templates and tools you can use to streamline the process (more on that below). For now, let\u2019s tackle some of the challenges so you can see how they can be overcome.\n\nNot everyone has the same understanding of why and how traceability should be performed. Stakeholders in sponsor or management positions may only view requirements traceability from a standard or regulatory perspective. They see it as a \u201cmust-have\u201d but may not understand the additional benefits of requirements traceability (as discussed above) in the way a project or systems engineer might.\n\nOne way to tackle this obstacle is to educate stakeholders on what can be achieved if end-to-end traceability is achieved. Share this article with everyone involved in your development process so they can have a basic understanding of why requirements traceability is an essential part of requirements management, beyond simply knowing they need it to cover their bases.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons a company might be slow to adopt traceability. Training is one such example. As considered regarding stakeholders, not all teams or individuals working on a project know why traceability is so crucial, or they simply may not know how to execute proper traceability correctly. Additionally, some people may be worried that traceability data from their decision points could come back to bite them.\n\nIf this is a challenge for your organization, again, education is imperative. But even beyond that, you need to create a culture in which traceability is seen as an inherent part of the development process. Start by creating clear policies regarding how the organization manages traceability. Then develop a positive training program for all new and existing employees to complete. If you choose a requirements management tool, make sure it has a strong track record of being\u00a0[intuitive and easy to use software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-names-jama-connect-winter-2021-leader-alm-software/)\u00a0that adapts to your process\u2014not the other way around.\n\nGetting an entire development organization on the same page regarding requirements traceability, then ensuring proper execution, can be a costly endeavor. The time spent developing policies, conducting training, and creating/maintaining traceability data add up and can even make folks feel less productive. Additionally, you may choose to adopt a traceability tool to streamline your process, which means upfront costs will be higher than previous projects.\n\nOvercoming this obstacle requires a mindset change. We urge you to consider the cost of doing nothing. Unproductive work time, lengthy time-to-market, rework, and defects are all extremely expensive symptoms of inadequate requirements traceability. Each of these carries a hefty price tag. For a look at exactly how much these complications could be costing your organization, check out the\u00a0[calculators on pages 9-11 in our Buyer\u2019s Guide](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tool). While there are costs to implementing requirements traceability and management tools, the amount saved throughout the development process far outweighs the short-term investment.\n\nWhen building complex products, change is inevitable. It is essential that team members know about the changes and scope their impact across the product development lifecycle. That means looking closely at any related system requirements, downstream requirements, and verification tests that may be affected.\n\nPerforming this activity can be cumbersome and time consuming with manual tools. And the associated risks are similar to doing nothing, simply because you cannot be sure you\u2019ve accounted for everything when dealing with static documents and human error.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced this setback in your organization, it may be time to explore automated requirements management tools that enable [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability).\n\nSome development teams are still tracing requirement relationships using Word or Excel documents and collaborating via email. A Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is one example of a document that manually traces elements of requirements management including, business requirements, objectives, design elements, and test cases via a spreadsheet. Teams input the list of requirements and fill in the related data. The spreadsheet is static but is updated manually by the team throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nThere can be advantages to using a RTM if you are developing a product that doesn\u2019t have many requirements. And it is better than not tracing at all. You can even use a template to create an RTM. However, if your product is complex, with many requirements, you\u2019ll likely experience many of the challenges discussed above.\n\nIn the case of complex products, a RTM\u00a0does not have the functionality you\u2019ll need to keep up with the pace of change and create a quality product in the timeframe required by stakeholders.\u00a0[Flexible requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-application-lifecycle-management-tools/)\u00a0like Jama Connect can even capture trace relationships across teams and toolsets, further enhancing the benefits of traceability.\n\nRegulated industries need requirements management to demonstrate compliance with industry standards. There are specific ways reviewers and regulators must receive regulatory submissions. To pass an audit you must present proof of comprehensive traceability.\n\nIf comprehensive traceability wasn\u2019t performed throughout your development process, a lot of time will be committed to gathering the necessary information after the fact. Even if traceability was meticulously maintained in Word or Excel, there will still be time spent compiling it into an acceptable format for regulatory submission. In the meantime, competitors that make traceability inherent to their process will be first to market.\n\nSound familiar?

Whether you\u2019re a systems engineer working on requirements for complex projects or a software developer juggling multiple code revisions, version control streamlines the process, reduces errors, and ensures teams can collaborate effectively.\n\nIn this subchapter, we\u2019ll explore the fundamentals of version control for requirements, its importance, actionable strategies for implementation, how tools like Jama Connect empower teams, and answers to common questions.\n\n### Why is Version Control Important?\n\nVersion control plays a vital role across industries where precision, traceability, and collaboration are paramount. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s indispensable:\n\n- **Clarity in Changes:** Version control allows teams to track what changed, who made the change, and why.\n- **Efficient Collaboration:** Teams working across geographies can simultaneously contribute without overriding others\u2019 work.\n- **Error Recovery:** Access to previous file versions ensures a safety net to recover from mistakes.\n- **Streamlined Regulatory Compliance:** Industries like medical devices or aerospace, where compliance is critical, use version control to provide documentation for audits.\n\nSimply put, it\u2019s a systemized approach to maintaining consistency and accountability while ensuring flexibility and adaptability.\n\n> \u201cThe version control [in Jama Connect] is second to none and the flexibility makes it easy to customize projects and exports.\u201d \u2013 Technical Writer, Communications Company\n\n![Four pillars of Version Control shown in an illustration of their parts making up the point of a pencil; error recovery, regulatory compliance, clarity in changes, efficient collaboratio.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/08/The-Pillars-of-Version-Control-982x1030.png)\n\n### How Does Version Control Work?\n\nVersion control systems (VCS) operate by capturing and managing changes to files or items. Below are two widely used concepts in version control:\n\n**1. Versioning**\n\nThis involves creating incremental changes to individual items or files. Each saved change becomes a \u201cversion\u201d along with associated comments and metadata.\n\n**2. Baselines**\n\nBaselines represent a snapshot of an entire project or a set of items at a particular point in time. These are commonly used to capture an approved state of a project.\n\nKey takeaway: Baselines preserve project context, whereas incremental versions ensure detailed history tracking of single items.\n\n> \u201cJama Connect\u2019s largest impact has largely been with the organization and version control management of our requirements database. Managing risks has also been very effective but using Jama Connect to manage our immense database of 10,000+ requirements has been the most helpful. \u201d \u2013 Systems Engineer, Aerospace & Defense\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-and-traceability-solution/)\n\n### Actionable Strategies to Implement Version Control\n\n**1. Standardize Processes**\n\n- Define workflows for version tracking at both item and project levels.\n- Use consistent naming conventions for files and versions.\n\n**2. Leverage Automation**\n\n- Use tools like Jama Connect to reduce manual tracking overhead and ensure every change is captured seamlessly.\n\n**3. Centralize Changes**\n\n- Maintain a single repository where all team members collaborate, ensuring transparency and accountability.\n\n*Pro Tip:* Automating baselines, as offered by Jama Connect, simplifies monitoring the progression of large projects.\n\n![Step chart showing the actionable steps of implementing version control; standardize processes, leverage automation, and centralize changes.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/08/Implementing-Version-Control-1030x695.png)\n\n### How Jama Connect Facilitates Version Control\n\nJama Connect provides robust version control capabilities tailored to address real-world challenges of systems engineers handling complex projects. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- **Item-Level Versioning:** Tracks incremental versions of items with clear comparisons highlighting changed, added, or removed data.\n- **Baselines for Project Snapshots:** Allows teams to capture full project snapshots or subsets to preserve and compare at a point in time. Every time you initiate a review in Jama Connect, the platform automatically creates a baseline of those items.\n- **Seamless Collaboration:** Integrates with tools to streamline updates and communication.\n\nFor a detailed walkthrough, [explore Jama Connect\u2019s features on tracking changes.](https://help.jamasoftware.com/ah/en/getting-to-know-jama-connect-features/tracking-changes-in-your-project.html)\n\n*Key Insight:* Automating version control with Jama Connect dramatically reduces manual effort and errors when managing revisions across multiple teams.\n\n> \u201cThe introduction of Jama within our R&D enabled an explicit traceability across the development.

What\u2019s the difference between Versioning and Baselines?**\n\nVersioning tracks changes at an individual item level, while baselines capture snapshots of entire projects or item groups for historical or review purposes.\n\n**2. How does version control improve compliance?**\n\nVersion control systems create an auditable trail of changes, allowing teams to quickly generate documentation supporting regulatory audits.\n\n**3. Can version control handle scope creep in projects?**\n\nYes. By tracking incremental changes and baselines, it becomes easier to manage adjustments, revert unwanted changes, and maintain control over evolving project scopes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhether managing software or complex systems, version control ensures teams work efficiently and collaboratively while maintaining high standards of accuracy and compliance.

From medical devices and pharmaceuticals to electronics and automotive, traceability plays a pivotal role in improving quality control, and adhering to regulatory compliance. However, despite its significance, businesses often encounter numerous challenges when implementing effective traceability systems.\n\nIn this subchapter, we\u2019ll explore some three key traceability challenges faced by organizations, why it is so vital in the modern development landscape, and what you can do to improve your traceability practices. But first, let\u2019s set the stage as to what requirements traceability is and why it\u2019s so important.\n\n### Why is Traceability Important?\n\nTraceability serves as a fundamental building block for several critical aspects of modern business operations. Here are some key reasons why traceability is of paramount importance:\n\n- **Quality Control and Risk Mitigation:** Traceability empowers businesses to identify the source of defects or issues in their products or processes quickly. By pinpointing the root cause, organizations can take corrective actions promptly, reducing the risk of widespread problems and enhancing overall product, systems, and software quality.\n- **Consumer Safety and Trust:** In industries like medical devices and pharmaceuticals, traceability ensures that any potential hazards or recalls can be contained efficiently, safeguarding consumer safety. This transparency fosters trust and loyalty among customers, positively impacting a company\u2019s reputation.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Meeting regulatory standards is non-negotiable for businesses offering complex, safe products. Traceability helps organizations comply with industry-specific regulations, avoiding fines, penalties, and legal liabilities.\n- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Traceability enables better visibility and understanding of supply chain dynamics. This, in turn, facilitates informed decision-making, minimizes waste, and improves overall supply chain efficiency.\n- **Continuous Improvement:** By analyzing data collected through traceability systems, businesses can identify opportunities for optimization and innovation. This leads to continuous improvement in products, processes, and overall operations.\n\n### What is Requirements Traceability? Connecting the Dots\n\nRequirements traceability is the practice of linking product, software, or system requirements to design, development, testing, and final delivery. This process ensures that every stage of the product\u2019s lifecycle aligns with the initial set of requirements. By establishing a clear traceability path, organizations can enhance product quality, reduce defects, and mitigate the risk of project failure. However, challenges arise when managing complex projects with numerous interdependencies, making it challenging to maintain clear and comprehensive traceability matrices. Employing advanced project management and requirement tracking tools can aid in addressing these challenges effectively.\n\n![V Model image showing Traceability in the Requirements Management and Product Development Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/08/Jama-Connect-V-Model-1-1030x1030.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Extending Live Traceability\u2122 to Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) with Jama Connect\u00ae](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/extending-live-traceability-to-product-lifecycle-management-plm-with-jama-connect)\n\n### Three Key Traceability Challenges\n\n**1: Compliance Traceability: Navigating the Regulatory Maze**\n\nCompliance traceability refers to the ability of an organization to track and document the complete history of a product or process to ensure conformity with applicable regulations. Different industries have specific compliance requirements \u2013 such as ISO 26262 for automotive and ISO 14971 for medical devices \u2013 that must be met to ensure consumer safety and to protect public health. Maintaining compliance can be challenging due to the complexity of regulations, which often vary between countries and are updated from time to time. As a result, businesses must invest significant effort in establishing comprehensive traceability measures to stay ahead of evolving compliance standards. Without proper traceability, organizations face failed audits, delays to market, and loss of market share.\n\n**2: Lot Traceability: Unraveling Product Journey**\n\nLot traceability involves the tracking of individual batches or lots of products from the point of origin to the end consumer. In industries like pharmaceuticals and electronics, where product recalls can have serious consequences, lot traceability is vital for identifying and addressing issues swiftly and accurately. The challenge lies in accurately capturing and managing data throughout the product\u2019s lifecycle, especially in industries with complex supply chains. Implementing advanced labeling and data management systems can help overcome these hurdles, ensuring the ability to trace the exact journey of each product lot.\n\n**3: Traceability Platform: The Need for Interoperability**\n\nA traceability platform is a centralized system that captures and consolidates data from various stages of the supply chain or production process. Developing a unified traceability platform is essential for streamlining data collection, analysis, and reporting. However, one of the significant challenges is achieving interoperability between different stakeholders, such as design teams, engineering, quality assurance, suppliers, and manufacturers. Integration issues, data format discrepancies, and data security concerns can hinder the seamless exchange of information, making it critical for organizations to work towards standardized data formats and secure communication protocols.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### How to Improve Traceability for Better Accountability and Efficiency\n\n#### Traceability Score\u2122 \u2013 An Empirical Way to Reduce the Risk of Late Requirements:\n\nLate requirements are a well-known risk to product development \u2013 however, there has never been an empirical method to mitigate the risk of late requirements and the burden they put on project teams \u2013 until now.\n\n[Read this research study](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/research-notes-traceability-score) to learn more about how, using our proprietary database of metadata from over 50,000 complex product development projects, Jama Software\u00ae is the first to:\n\n- Define late requirements\n- Measure the burden that late requirements add to product development projects\n- Identify managerial practices that empirically reduce the risk of late requirements\n- Show how measuring and monitoring the Traceability Score of projects helps resolve issues early and mitigate development risk.\n\n### Live Traceability\u2122 in Jama Connect\u00ae\n\nImplementing a traceability system manually is very challenging, using a modern requirements management and traceability platform like Jama Connect\u00ae automatically creates Live Traceability \u2122 throughout the development process.

This digital thread signifies a continuous and interconnected flow of digital information that traverses the entire lifecycle of a product, project, or process. This chapter of the requirements management guide is an overview of the digital thread, highlighting its significance and how it optimizes operations across many industries and sectors.\n\nAccording to [CIMdata](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/cimdata-digital-thread-in-aerospace-and-defense) \u201cThe concept of a digital thread providing automated linkage of multiple representations of a product, each tuned to the needs of various creators and consumers along the lifecycle, is very powerful.\u201d\n\n### Understanding the Essence of the Digital Thread\n\nAccording to a well-respect paper from MIT titled *Engineering with Digital Thread*, the definition of the digital thread is \u201cA data-driven architecture that links together information generated from across the product lifecycle and is envisioned to be the primary or authoritative data and communication platform for a company\u2019s products at any instance of time.\u201d\n\nThe digital thread is an orchestrated flow of information, ensuring its accessibility and relevance across engineering domains such as hardware, software, manufacturing, operation, and maintenance. The core principle of the digital thread is to give stakeholders the right information, precisely when it is needed, enabling them to make well-informed decisions, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency.\n\nThis interconnected information embodies a plethora of critical aspects including: design specifications, manufacturing instructions, testing data, operational performance metrics, maintenance records, and more. The digital thread also ensures that all stakeholders, whatever role they have in the lifecycle, have unfettered access to pertinent and up-to-date information, facilitating a [holistic understanding and fostering collaboration.](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/collaboration/guide-to-optimizing-engineering-team-collaboration)\n\n[In a previous blog post](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), Jama Software\u2019s CEO, Marc Osofsky, spoke about the importance of the digital thread, saying, \u201cThe product development process is often fragmented across siloed teams and tools which leads to significant risk of product delays, defects, cost overruns, failed verification and validation, recalls, etc. End-to-end process visibility is required for better cross-team collaboration and the early detection of anomalies to reduce these risks. To solve this, some organizations attempt to force everyone to use single vendor platforms with strong functionality in one area but little to no functionality in another, forgoing their choice of best-of-breed tools. This solution is neither practical \u2014 nor particularly realistic \u2014 since engineers are (and should continue to be) allowed to choose discipline-specific tooling which optimize their activities.\u201d\n\n### The Multifaceted Components of the Digital Thread\n\n![Image of teams working across the digital thread.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2020/12/live-traceability-diagram-blog-image.jpg)\n\n**1.

But where do you start? How can you improve a process that isn\u2019t serving your team as it should?\n\nA requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is usually the first choice. It has low barriers to entry, including ease of getting started and virtually no upfront cost. We\u2019ve even created a [free requirements traceability matrix template](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Requirements_Traceability_Matrix_Template.xlsx) so you can get started today.\n\n[Requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/?utm_campaign=related+blog) software tools, such as [Jama Connect\u00ae](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/), are also an option. This article will explain:\n\n- What is a requirements traceability matrix\n- What are the different types of traceability matrices\n- How to create a requirements traceability matrix\n- When a company would benefit from using requirements management software instead of using a requirements traceability matrix in Excel\n\n### What is a Requirements Traceability Matrix?\n\nA requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a document in which product teams track the relationships between requirements, verification, risks and other artifacts throughout the product development process. The matrix content may include business requirements, system and subsystem requirements, design elements, test cases, defects, as well as pertinent information about these items, e.g., status, depending on the kind of requirements traceability employed. Its purpose is to demonstrate that requirements have been satisfied by showing a direct trace from individual requirements to their implementation and verification\n\nTo ensure you have a concrete understanding of the most effective way to implement requirements traceability in your organization, this article will also compare manually managed traceability matrix with those managed by application lifecycle management (ALM) tools. These requirements management tools automatically create trace relationships that develop a digital thread from high level requirements through low level requirements and testing.\n\n### The Purpose of Using a Requirements Traceability Matrix\n\nProduct teams need to ensure they are building the right thing. To do this they must keep track of requirements data, including the testing that verifies all the requirements are met. In some industries this proof is required for functional safety or regulatory compliance.\n\nRequirements traceability enables multi-disciplinary teams involved in product definition, design, risk evaluation and verification to relate work items from their activities and analyze connects and impact across complex, highly interconnected systems. Additionally, stakeholders and regulators can see that product requirements generated from the business or even regulations and standards are met.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Convergent Dental Selects Jama Connect\u00ae For Its Live Requirements Traceability](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/convergent-dental-selects-jama-connect-for-its-live-requirements-traceability)\n\n### Different Types of RTMs \u2013 With Examples\n\nAt a high level, there are three types of requirements traceability matrices: forward traceability, backward traceability, and bidirectional traceability. Each type of traceability matrix is created to ensure high-level requirements have been decomposed to appropriate levels of abstraction, lower-level requirements are tied to a higher-level need, and that the verification test cases are in place with their results. The difference is in which direction of events is the user able to view\u2014forward in time, backward in time, or both. The difference in types is significant based on the information the user needs to gather from the matrix: e.g., are all my subsystem requirements tracing to a system need? Have verifications for all my requirements passed? If we change this high-level requirement what are the impacts downstream?\n\nA **forward traceability matrix** traces from customer, or high-level, needs through to system and subsystem requirements to all corresponding downstream design artifacts and test cases. Following forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes and the potential impact of those changes at any time throughout development. Additionally, it ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.\n\nExample: Midway through the development process, a computer company lowers the weight requirement in its new laptop. Teams can use forward traceability to investigate the impact of change on the project. Any related requirements or resulting artifacts can be adjusted accordingly and test cases can be tweaked to ensure full test coverage.\n\nA **backward traceability matrix** (sometimes called a reverse traceability matrix) begins at verified work products and traces to upstream requirements and the customer needs they fulfill. This trace gives visibility into why specific artifacts were created and how different pieces of a system fit together. Tracing in this way allows testers to find gaps or missing requirements. Additionally, teams can manage scope and avoid scope creep by ensuring lower-level needs directly trace to business, customer and/or regulatory requirements.\n\nExample: Continuing the example above, backward or reverse traceability gives teams producing the laptop the ability to look at the customer need that caused the change in the weight requirement. They may also want to determine if any project requirements are out of scope, which they can therefore eliminate to meet the new weight requirement and still deliver on time.\n\nA **bidirectional traceability matrix** is the combination of both forward and backward traceability in one place. It is the optimal type of traceability because it gives teams full visibility from customer needs and requirements specifications through building, testing, changes, and defects\u2014and back.\n\nIf bidirectional traceability were employed, the computer manufacturing company in the examples above would only need to look in one place for all the information in both the forward and backward traceability matrices.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### How to Create a Requirements Traceability Matrix in Excel \u2013 Step by Step\n\n#### Step 1: Decide what type of traceability matrix you need\n\nWhen creating a requirements traceability matrix, you want to start with the end in mind. What are your goals for the matrix? And what type of traceability matrix do you need to meet that goal? Take another look at the different types of RTMs just discussed for inspiration.\n\n#### Step 2: Decide what components should be included\n\nOnce you know what you want your requirements traceability matrix to do for you, you can determine what content, or work items, should be included. For example, you may want to include these three typical types of items: Requirements, Tests, and Defects. You\u2019ll likely want to include the following information in your requirements traceability matrix:\n\n**High-level Requirements**\n\n- Customer needs\n- Business requirements\n- Requirement ID (for each)\n\n**System and Lower-level Requirements**\n\n- System Requirements (trace to High-level requirements)\n- Hardware, software requirements (trace to System)\n- Requirement ID (for each)\n\n**Verification**\n\n- Test Case (trace to requirements)\n- Test case ID\n- Verification Result (e.g., Pass/Fail)\n\n**Defects**\n\n- Defect description (trace to verification)\n- Defect ID\n\nYou may want to include other work items in your RTM, such as:\n\n- System architecture\n- Subsystem design elements\n- Risk analysis\n- Functional safety goals\n- User needs\n\nAdditionally, you may want to include pertinent information, other than a unique ID, about each of the work items included in the traceability matrix. For example, it may be helpful to include their status or a short description.\n\n#### Step 3: Build a traceability matrix in Excel\n\nNow that you know the type of matrix, you\u2019ll employ to meet your goal, it\u2019s time to start building your spreadsheet with your chosen elements. These should be inputted as column headings.\n\nRequirements traceability matrix spreadsheets can be templatized, like the downloadable traceability matrix template we\u2019ve created, to get you started quickly. You can tweak the columns to be sure you capture the information you need and meet your defined goals.\n\n#### Step 4: Gather and input the data\n\nTo get the right information in your traceability matrix, you\u2019ll need to gather data from a variety of sources \u2014 the business requirement document (BRD), functional or technical requirement documents, and the test case document.\n\nOnce you have collected the information you need, start by adding each high-level requirement (e.g., customer needs) and their related system and lower-level requirements. . Then assign each requirement a unique requirement ID. From there you can add as much detail as you need to based on the columns you opted to use.\n\n#### Step 5: Get to work\n\nYou can begin work as soon as you have all the necessary data input into your requirements traceability matrix. That work includes the steadfast upkeep of the RTM.\n\nAs the product development activities continue, you will find that requirements, tests, defects, etc. will be added, obsoleted or changed. While it is obvious that the documents that house this information must be updated (e.g., the system requirements document or verification protocols) to reflect these changes, it is important to also assess the RTM and update accordingly. This may involve adding new item and/or updating relationships between items. Without diligent maintenance, you will be unable to realize any benefits of requirements traceability. For example, you\u2019ll lose any enhanced visibility you were hoping to achieve, and there\u2019s little chance of increasing efficiency or improving change impact analysis. It is especially risky to use an outdated RTM in the analysis of coverage or for determining change impact. As significant as the traceability matrix is to the quality and safety of a product, decision-making and analysis supported by a neglected matrix can lead to decreased quality and impact schedules.\n\n### Risks of Using Spreadsheets for Requirements Traceability When Working with Complex Products in Regulated Industries\n\nMedical devices, automobiles, or aerospace developers, for example, must prove they are developing safe products that meet all the necessary standards and regulations.\n\nFor complex products and industries that require regulatory or functional safety compliance, managing requirements traceability in documents is a rigorous and precarious route. When relying upon static documents like RTMs, you encounter a variety of risks:\n\n- **Inefficiency.** Manual data input slows teams down and takes team members away from performing central job functions. Furthermore, with the complex products being built, there would need to be many more columns and hundreds or thousands of rows of data. It would be near impossible to keep everything up to date while maintaining version control, giving access to the right stakeholders, and still being able to glean insights on relationships.\n- **User error.** A requirements traceability matrix is prone to user error as it is updated manually by the team throughout the development lifecycle. Often, information is compiled from a variety of sources such as emails or other spreadsheets, which may have outdated or wrong information themselves.\n- **User fatigue.** RTM maintenance is usually seen as busy work. This means data entry might be put off until after other work is complete. This negates the in-production value of requirements traceability. In addition, you run the risk of missing important compliance-related information should you be unable to track down all the disparate emails and documents in which the records live.\n\nA requirements management tool, such as Jama Connect, can streamline requirements traceability matrices because it records bidirectional traceability for you as work is performed. It also [simplifies the validation and verification process.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/meet-jama-connect/)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [ What is Requirements Traceability and Why Does it Matter for Product Teams? ](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\n### The Advantages of Using Requirements Management Software for Traceability\n\nMost requirements management tools can support traceability. Jama Connect, however, replaces static traceability matrices by creating dynamic views of trace relationships we call \u2013 Live Traces.

To do this they must keep track of requirements data, including the testing that verifies all the requirements are met.

Additionally, stakeholders and regulators can see that product requirements generated from the business or even regulations and standards are met.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Convergent Dental Selects Jama Connect\u00ae For Its Live Requirements Traceability](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/convergent-dental-selects-jama-connect-for-its-live-requirements-traceability)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Different Types of RTMs \u2013 With Examples", "level": 3, "content": "At a high level, there are three types of requirements traceability matrices: forward traceability, backward traceability, and bidirectional traceability. Each type of traceability matrix is created to ensure high-level requirements have been decomposed to appropriate levels of abstraction, lower-level requirements are tied to a higher-level need, and that the verification test cases are in place with their results. The difference is in which direction of events is the user able to view\u2014forward in time, backward in time, or both. The difference in types is significant based on the information the user needs to gather from the matrix: e.g., are all my subsystem requirements tracing to a system need? Have verifications for all my requirements passed? If we change this high-level requirement what are the impacts downstream?\n\nA **forward traceability matrix** traces from customer, or high-level, needs through to system and subsystem requirements to all corresponding downstream design artifacts and test cases. Following forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes and the potential impact of those changes at any time throughout development. Additionally, it ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.\n\nExample: Midway through the development process, a computer company lowers the weight requirement in its new laptop. Teams can use forward traceability to investigate the impact of change on the project. Any related requirements or resulting artifacts can be adjusted accordingly and test cases can be tweaked to ensure full test coverage.\n\nA **backward traceability matrix** (sometimes called a reverse traceability matrix) begins at verified work products and traces to upstream requirements and the customer needs they fulfill. This trace gives visibility into why specific artifacts were created and how different pieces of a system fit together. Tracing in this way allows testers to find gaps or missing requirements. Additionally, teams can manage scope and avoid scope creep by ensuring lower-level needs directly trace to business, customer and/or regulatory requirements.\n\nExample: Continuing the example above, backward or reverse traceability gives teams producing the laptop the ability to look at the customer need that caused the change in the weight requirement. They may also want to determine if any project requirements are out of scope, which they can therefore eliminate to meet the new weight requirement and still deliver on time.\n\nA **bidirectional traceability matrix** is the combination of both forward and backward traceability in one place. It is the optimal type of traceability because it gives teams full visibility from customer needs and requirements specifications through building, testing, changes, and defects\u2014and back.\n\nIf bidirectional traceability were employed, the computer manufacturing company in the examples above would only need to look in one place for all the information in both the forward and backward traceability matrices.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How to Create a Requirements Traceability Matrix in Excel \u2013 Step by Step", "level": 3, "content": "", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Step 1: Decide what type of traceability matrix you need", "level": 4, "content": "When creating a requirements traceability matrix, you want to start with the end in mind.

They provide an organized way to make sure that the system\u2019s planning, execution, and testing satisfy each requirement. When utilizing trace matrices in challenging development projects, however, it is important to consider a number of their known drawbacks.\n\n#### Here are five key limitations of using a traditional traceability matrix for requirements management:\n\n**1. Limited Visibility: **In projects with a lot of requirements and design components, trace matrices can grow significantly in size and complexity. As a result, it can be difficult for teams and stakeholders to get a comprehensive understanding of the complete system \u2014 and to understand how each requirement relates to the other components. This often results in mistakes and gaps in the trace matrix, which lowers the system\u2019s quality and introduces risk to both the project and the product.\n\n**2. Maintenance Overhead: **Trace matrices require constant maintenance throughout the development process. As new requirements are added or changed, the trace matrix needs to be updated to reflect these changes. This can be time-consuming and can take away from other important development tasks. Additionally, it can be challenging to keep track of every change, which can result in mistakes in the trace matrix.\n\n**3. Limited Scope: **Trace matrices are typically limited to the scope of the specific project they were designed for. They are insufficient for tracing issues that span across various disciplines, such as security or efficiency, which may require a different, more robust, traceability strategy. Additionally, trace matrices might not fully account for a system\u2019s complexity, such as sudden changes or relationships between components, which can result in unforeseen issues.\n\n**4. Lack of Context: **Trace matrices only provide a static view of the system and do not capture the dynamic context in which the system operates. For example, a requirement may be met by a design element, but the design element may have unintended consequences when combined with other elements in the system. Trace matrices may not capture these interactions, which can lead to bugs or other issues in the final system.\n\n**5. Limited Support for Agile Development:\u00a0**Trace matrices are typically associated with traditional, waterfall-style development processes, which do not align well with Agile development methodologies. Agile development processes emphasize collaboration, iterative development, and quick feedback cycles, which can be difficult to reconcile with the strict traceability requirements of a trace matrix. As a result, trace matrices may not be well-suited for Agile development projects.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Jama Software Guide to Requirements Traceability](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-jama-software-guide-to-requirements-traceability)\n\n### Five Advantages of Using a Robust Requirements Management and Traceability Solution, Like Jama Connect\u00ae, Over a Static Traceability Matrix\n\n[Jama Connect\u00ae\u2019s](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/) powerful, yet easy-to-use, requirements management and traceability platform bring people and data together in one place, providing visibility and actionable insight into the complete product development lifecycle. Teams and stakeholders \u2014 regardless of their location \u2014 can easily share updates in seconds, discover issues weeks sooner, and have one place to collaborate with key stakeholders \u2014 in real time. As a result, Jama Connect offers many advantages over using a traditional traceability matrix.\n\n#### Here are five advantages of Jama Connect:\n\n**1. Automation:** Jama Connect automates many tasks that would be tedious and time-consuming to do manually. For example, it can automatically generate traceability matrices, link requirements to test cases, and track changes to requirements. And, because testing is built into Jama Connect, users can take advantage of our trace view to navigate from high level requirements, all the way down to test cases and defects. This allows users to view any failed tests or open defects that are associated with their upstream requirements. Because traditional trace matrices are static, they are unable to benefit from this type of automation.\n\n**2. Visibility:** Jama Connect provides a more comprehensive view of the requirements and their relationships than a static traceability matrix by automatically generating Live Traceability\u2122 which allows you to navigate levels of traceability both upstream AND downstream. With Jama Connect, you can see the entire requirements hierarchy, including parent-child relationships, dependencies, and impact analysis.\n\n**3. Collaboration:** Jama Connect makes it easy for teams to collaborate on requirements.

They provide an organized way to make sure that the system\u2019s planning, execution, and testing satisfy each requirement. When utilizing trace matrices in challenging development projects, however, it is important to consider a number of their known drawbacks.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Here are five key limitations of using a traditional traceability matrix for requirements management:", "level": 4, "content": "**1. Limited Visibility: **In projects with a lot of requirements and design components, trace matrices can grow significantly in size and complexity. As a result, it can be difficult for teams and stakeholders to get a comprehensive understanding of the complete system \u2014 and to understand how each requirement relates to the other components. This often results in mistakes and gaps in the trace matrix, which lowers the system\u2019s quality and introduces risk to both the project and the product.\n\n**2. Maintenance Overhead: **Trace matrices require constant maintenance throughout the development process. As new requirements are added or changed, the trace matrix needs to be updated to reflect these changes. This can be time-consuming and can take away from other important development tasks. Additionally, it can be challenging to keep track of every change, which can result in mistakes in the trace matrix.\n\n**3. Limited Scope: **Trace matrices are typically limited to the scope of the specific project they were designed for. They are insufficient for tracing issues that span across various disciplines, such as security or efficiency, which may require a different, more robust, traceability strategy. Additionally, trace matrices might not fully account for a system\u2019s complexity, such as sudden changes or relationships between components, which can result in unforeseen issues.\n\n**4. Lack of Context: **Trace matrices only provide a static view of the system and do not capture the dynamic context in which the system operates. For example, a requirement may be met by a design element, but the design element may have unintended consequences when combined with other elements in the system. Trace matrices may not capture these interactions, which can lead to bugs or other issues in the final system.\n\n**5. Limited Support for Agile Development:\u00a0**Trace matrices are typically associated with traditional, waterfall-style development processes, which do not align well with Agile development methodologies. Agile development processes emphasize collaboration, iterative development, and quick feedback cycles, which can be difficult to reconcile with the strict traceability requirements of a trace matrix. As a result, trace matrices may not be well-suited for Agile development projects.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Jama Software Guide to Requirements Traceability](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-jama-software-guide-to-requirements-traceability)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Five Advantages of Using a Robust Requirements Management and Traceability Solution, Like Jama Connect\u00ae, Over a Static Traceability Matrix", "level": 3, "content": "[Jama Connect\u00ae\u2019s](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/) powerful, yet easy-to-use, requirements management and traceability platform bring people and data together in one place, providing visibility and actionable insight into the complete product development lifecycle.

This requires gathering stakeholder input to build system architecture, managing high-level requirements to create detailed user stories and implementing verification and validation to detect issues. Collaborating with various stakeholders while achieving standards compliance and competing in today\u2019s marketplace requires a deeper level of traceability.\n\nRequirements traceability is required by many industry standards to ensure product quality and safety. The industry standards are based on decades of progress made in systems and quality engineering research with requirements traceability at the core. Benefits from requirements traceability are achieved if and only if traceability is used as a tool during the product development process.\n\nThese benefits include greatly reduced or eliminated delays, defects, cost overruns, and rework. Here is an overview of the best practice approach to achieve Live Traceability\u2122.\n\n### Live Traceability vs. After-the-fact Traceability\n\nLet\u2019s start with some definitions to make sure we are all on the same page. Requirement traceability is defined as tracking the development progress of product requirements from definition and design through development, testing, verification, and validation. There are two forms of requirement traceability: after-the-fact traceability and Live Traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Experience Live Traceability\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/wistia-jama-software-and-jama-connect-promotional-videos/experience-live-traceability-in-jama-connect)\n\n### What is traditional, after-the-fact Traceability?\n\n**After-the-fact traceability** occurs after the product has been developed and is typically a highly manual effort to try and re-create artifacts to demonstrate traceability that should have occurred during the development process but did not. This effort is undertaken solely to comply with industry standards and satisfy auditor requests for demonstration of process maturity.\n\n### What is Live Traceability?\n\nJama Software defines Live Traceability \u2122 as the ability to see the most **up-to-date and complete upstream and downstream information for any requirement**, no matter the stage of systems development or how many siloed tools and teams it spans.\n\nThis enables engineering and product management processes to be **managed through data** and to improve performance **in real-time**.\n\nLive Traceability occurs in real time as the product development process progresses to improve overall productivity (by ensuring engineers across disciplines are always working off the most recent and correct versions) and to reduce the risk of negative product outcomes (delays, defects, rework, cost overruns, recalls, etc.) through early detection of issues.\n\nThe benefits of early detection of issues are significant. [Research by INCOSE](https://ndiastorage.blob.core.usgovcloudapi.net/ndia/2012/system/ttrack914871.pdf) found that issues not found until verification and validation are 40 to 110 times more costly than if found during design. For this reason, most companies want Live Traceability but are stuck with legacy tools and spreadsheets that do not support it. Since each engineering discipline is allowed to choose its own tooling, the result is a large number of tools with no relationship rules or mechanisms to create Live Traceability across them.\n\n### Why does Live Traceability matter?\n\nThe #1 problem product engineering organizations face is complying with traceability requirements spanning siloed teams and tools. Organizations are often encumbered by the highly manual and time-consuming review of information across numerous spreadsheets.\n\n### Live Traceability\u2122 Realized\n\nAchieve Live Traceability across your best-of-breed toolchain. To make this continuous sync as easy as possible, Jama Connect Interchange is purpose-built to achieve Live Traceability between Jama Connect and Jira through a point and click interface.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Accelerate, Measure, and Improve the Systems Development Process with Live Traceability\u2122 in Jama Connect\u00ae](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/demo/accelerate-measure-and-improve-the-systems-development-process-with-live-traceability-in-jama-connect)\n\n### Key Benefits of Integrating Jama Connect with Jira for Live Traceability    Stay Aligned to Market and User Needs\n\nIntegrate upstream planning, requirements, and test plans into an iterative development process. Ensure what you build satisfies market, compliance, and user requirements.\n\n### Maintain Visibility into Downstream Development\n\nAccurately capture and communicate requirements, goals, progress, and interdependencies to remove friction throughout the development process.\n\n### Eliminate Late-Stage Rework and Quality Gaps Due to Misalignment\n\nCapture needs and maintain agreement on what you are building. Guarantee everyone is working off the most current spec, so the product/system ultimately delivers its intended value.\n\n### Support a Formal Change Management Process\n\nIdentify change impact implications of product requirements alterations and impacted owners so development teams make informed decisions as requirements evolve.\n\nSo how do you achieve Live Traceability?\n\n### Step 1: Define a Traceability Model\n\nLive Traceability requires a model of the key process elements and their relationship rules to monitor during the development process. The systems engineering V Model is a useful framework to start with for data object and relationship definition. Jama Connect\u00ae uniquely provides a point and click, configurable, relationship rule capability to enable Live Traceability. Below you see a sample relationship rule diagram from Jama Connect. Relationship rules vary by industry and company-specific requirements. Best practice templates are provided to comply with industry standards and configured to meet client-specific needs. The definition of a traceability model forms the foundation for model-based systems engineering since it defines model elements and their relationship to each other in a consistent manner across the entire system architecture.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/Step1.png)\n\n### Step 2: Setup Continuous Sync for Siloed Tools/Spreadsheets\n\nOnce the relationship rules are defined, the next step is to set up continuous sync with best-of-breed tools and spreadsheets used by the various engineering disciplines. The traceability diagram below shows a typical example of best-of-breed tools and where they sync in the Jama Connect relationship model to deliver Live Traceability.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/Step2.png)\n\n*Critical, best-of-breed tools for traceability are shown in this example. Additional and competitive alternatives to those listed are also supported.*\n\nMost companies prioritize the areas of the traceability model that are most prone to lead to costly issues in the absence of a continuous sync. Most commonly, these areas are:\n\n- **Software task management** \u2013 directly linking the decomposition of requirements into user stories enables Live Traceability through the software development process through testing and defect management. The most common best-of-breed tools used are Jira and Azure Dev Ops.\n- **Test automation** \u2013 test cases are managed in Jama Connect to align to requirements and ensure traceability across all engineering disciplines with the test automation results sync\u2019d to the traceability model at the verification step. The most common test automation tools are TestRail and qTest.\n- **Risk analysis (DFMEA/FMEA)** \u2013 is most often conducted in multiple Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and the assumption has been that Live Traceability was not possible with Excel. Jama Connect is the first requirements management solution to enable Live Traceability with Excel functions and spreadsheets. Risk teams can now work in their preferred spreadsheets AND for the first time achieve live traceability to stay in sync with changes made by any engineering team. Ansys Medini is also a supported integration.\n- **Model-based systems engineering (MBSE)** \u2013 the first step in MBSE is to define a relationship model between all product requirements. Once a relationship model is defined, then specifications can be determined through modeling. Jama Connect uniquely provides model-based requirements to sync logically with a SysML modeling tool like Cameo No Magic. Other requirements management tools do not ensure a model-based approach, which most often leads to inconsistent and conflicting fields across teams and projects and provides no coherent relationship model.\n\n### Step 3: Monitor for Exceptions\n\nLive Traceability provides the ability, for the first time, to manage by exception the end-to-end product development process across all engineering disciplines. The traceability model defines expected process behavior that can be compared to actual activity to generate exceptions. These exceptions are the early warning indicators of issues that most often lead to delays, cost overruns, rework, defects, and recalls. Below is a sample exception management dashboard in Jama Connect.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/Step3.png)\n\n### Benefits of Live Traceability\n\nThe main benefits of Live Traceability across best-of-breed tools are as follows:\n\n- Reduce the risk of delays, cost overruns, rework, defects, and recalls with early detection of issues through exception management and save 40 to 110 times the cost of issues identified late in the process.\n- Comply with industry standards with no after-the-fact manual effort.\n- No disruption to engineering teams that continue working in their chosen best-of-breed tools with no need to change tools, fields, values or processes.\n- Increase productivity and satisfaction of engineers with the confidence that they are always working on the latest version, reflective of all changes and comments.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Cover Best Practices for Requirements Traceability\n\nLIVE TRACEABILITY\u2122\n\n**Live Traceability** is the ability to see the most up-to-date and complete upstream and downstream information for any requirement, no matter the stage of systems development or how many siloed tools and teams it spans.\n\nPREVIOUSTraceability Matrix 101: Why It\u2019s Not the Ultimate Solution for Managing Requirements\n\nNEXT UPHow to Overcome Organizational Barriers to Live Requirements Traceability\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

One of the main barriers is that each engineering discipline (systems, software, hardware, electrical, risk, verification and validation) has optimized its own process and tools. When looking at the end-to-end product development process siloed teams, tools, and data make it very challenging to trace development activity from initial requirement definition through development and testing.\n\nAs a result, requirements traceability becomes a time-consuming, error-prone, frustrating, and manual, after-the-fact process. The inability for the product development organization to continually trace ongoing development efforts and changes back to user and system requirements results in missed requirements, defects, rework, delays, audit letters, and cost overruns.\n\n#### No common platform exists\n\nThe typical approach to solve this generic process problem with software is to force every user onto a single platform and follow one common process. This works for standard business processes in HR, Sales, and Finance, but engineering disciplines across systems, software, hardware, electrical, risk, test, verification, and validation each follow different methodologies and use multiple tools including spreadsheets, desktop, and homegrown applications. Each engineering discipline has optimized their own development environment and strongly resist any attempts to change. Engineering leadership defers to each engineering discipline to define how to best do their work and is loath to dictate processes and tools that will negatively impact the performance and morale of each engineering team.\n\nIn addition to the organizational barriers to standardization, no single platform is even close to currently existing which replaces these dozens of tools. A single platform would need to cover all of the following software categories AND address all functionality in spreadsheets (Excel), scripts, desktop, and homegrown tools: Requirements Management, CAD, MBSE, DFMEA/FMEA, software task management, software code management, automated software testing, hardware bench test tools, ALM, PLM, and more. Current efforts by legacy vendors to create a common SaaS platform to span all these software categories and reach parity with best-of-breed tools is moving very slowly.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [ Requirements Traceability: How to Go Live ](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-how-to-go-live)\n\n### How to achieve Live Requirements Traceability\u2122 without forcing change on engineering teams\n\nSo how does an organization achieve Live Traceability across a best-of-breed tool environment supporting disparate methodologies, terminologies, fields, and statuses? The answer is a 3-step approach:\n\n#### Step One\u00a0| Live Traceability Model\n\nDefine a Live Traceability model across the end-to-end product development process with relationship rules for the traceable data elements across best-of-breed tools. An automotive functional safety example is shown below. Here you can see the operational instantiation of functional safety standards requirements in a relationship model within Jama Connect\u00ae. All necessary traceable information is included with continuous syncs to best-of-breed tools within engineering teams to deliver Live Traceability.\n\n![Airborne Trace Model](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/01/Auto-Trace-Model-.png)\n\n#### Step Two | Adaptive Data Field Mapping\n\nTo achieve Live Traceability, integrations with best-of-breed tools (such as those shown in the example) are required.

One of the main barriers is that each engineering discipline (systems, software, hardware, electrical, risk, verification and validation) has optimized its own process and tools. When looking at the end-to-end product development process siloed teams, tools, and data make it very challenging to trace development activity from initial requirement definition through development and testing.\n\nAs a result, requirements traceability becomes a time-consuming, error-prone, frustrating, and manual, after-the-fact process. The inability for the product development organization to continually trace ongoing development efforts and changes back to user and system requirements results in missed requirements, defects, rework, delays, audit letters, and cost overruns.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "No common platform exists", "level": 4, "content": "The typical approach to solve this generic process problem with software is to force every user onto a single platform and follow one common process. This works for standard business processes in HR, Sales, and Finance, but engineering disciplines across systems, software, hardware, electrical, risk, test, verification, and validation each follow different methodologies and use multiple tools including spreadsheets, desktop, and homegrown applications. Each engineering discipline has optimized their own development environment and strongly resist any attempts to change. Engineering leadership defers to each engineering discipline to define how to best do their work and is loath to dictate processes and tools that will negatively impact the performance and morale of each engineering team.\n\nIn addition to the organizational barriers to standardization, no single platform is even close to currently existing which replaces these dozens of tools. A single platform would need to cover all of the following software categories AND address all functionality in spreadsheets (Excel), scripts, desktop, and homegrown tools: Requirements Management, CAD, MBSE, DFMEA/FMEA, software task management, software code management, automated software testing, hardware bench test tools, ALM, PLM, and more. Current efforts by legacy vendors to create a common SaaS platform to span all these software categories and reach parity with best-of-breed tools is moving very slowly.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [ Requirements Traceability: How to Go Live ](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-how-to-go-live)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How to achieve Live Requirements Traceability\u2122 without forcing change on engineering teams", "level": 3, "content": "So how does an organization achieve Live Traceability across a best-of-breed tool environment supporting disparate methodologies, terminologies, fields, and statuses?

Both\u00a0use cases reflect\u00a0an after-the-fact mindset that\u00a0limits the value that can be achieved from the effort put into establishing traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What Are the Benefits of End-to-End Traceability During Product Development?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability/)\n\n#### Analogies to other business-criticalfunctions\n\nTo view\u00a0something\u00a0we think we know well in a new light, it\u00a0is often helpful to place it\u00a0in a\u00a0different\u00a0context and look at it\u00a0from\u00a0a fresh perspective.\u00a0So,\u00a0let\u2019s give it a try and\u00a0compare traceability in the product development process to traceability in the new customer acquisition process.\n\nFor engineers,\u00a0these\u00a0processes may\u00a0at first appear to be too disparate for an apt analogy, but at a fundamental level, they are\u00a0quite\u00a0similar. Both start\u00a0with a documented\u00a0value (requirement vs. opportunity) that must transition through multiple phases\u00a0and involve many other functions to reach the desired outcome (release vs. win)\u00a0\u2014 and all sorts of things can go wrong along the way leading to delays, costs incurred,\u00a0and failure.\n\nThe aspect I want to focus on is\u00a0**how****\u00a0**these two processes are managed.\u00a0In the sales process,\u00a0the element of value\u00a0(the\u00a0opportunity)\u00a0is\u00a0**living**\u00a0\u2014\u00a0actively measured,\u00a0analyzed,\u00a0and tracked for exceptions\u00a0on a daily basis.\u00a0The\u00a0key process metrics are defined\u00a0with\u00a0ranges for acceptable performance.\u00a0Current process\u00a0performance\u00a0is\u00a0automatically calculated based on\u00a0the movement through stages of all opportunities.\u00a0Alerts are raised for opportunities stuck in\u00a0a process stage too long\u00a0(relative to\u00a0average dwell times)\u00a0and\u00a0predictions are made about future period performance based on\u00a0the opportunities in the system.\n\nIn contrast, for most product development organizations,\u00a0requirement\u00a0traceability\u00a0is static and\u00a0in\u00a0after-the-fact analysis and not\u00a0**living**\u00a0\u2014\u00a0in the way opportunities are traced in sales as described above.\u00a0To make requirement traceability living\u00a0(like\u00a0a\u00a0sales\u00a0opportunity)\u00a0traceability would require software-enabled best practices in the following areas:\n\n- Process metrics must be defined\n- Actual performance against process metrics must be captured\n- Once standard metric performance is defined, current performance must be compared to\u00a0the\u00a0standard\n- Exceptions need to be defined\n- Alerts need to be set up\u00a0to notify when exceptions occur\n- Learnings need to be incorporated into process improvement\n\nOnce these steps are taken\u00a0to improve\u00a0requirements\u00a0traceability,\u00a0then requirements\u00a0bec**ome living**, not static,\u00a0and performance improvement is possible: the risk of negative product outcomes\u00a0is\u00a0reduced,\u00a0and process performance\u00a0is\u00a0improved;

And as software, embedded systems and external sensors contribute to product complexity (not to mention the complications that arise when you\u2019re trying to unify multiple teams that contribute to a product) there is no chance that manual processes and static documentation can scale to support accurate impact analysis and quick decision-making. Requirements may be recorded, but if they\u2019re not in a\u00a0*system of action*, in situations like those above, you cannot effectively manage.\n\nGartner highlights one of the main reasons why companies struggle to achieve the benefits of traceability:\n\n*\u201cThe most widely adopted tools for requirements continue to be general document software such as Microsoft Office or Google Docs (40% to 50% of the market) due to cost, availability and familiarity. Yet these often lead to poorly managed requirements, thus eliminating and exceeding any cost benefit the tools themselves have. Requirements end up captured in a variety of documents and spreadsheets supplemented by post-it notes in unmanaged versions with no traceability or reuse. This creates a more costly user acceptance testing cycle, both in the time to execute as well as remediation of issues found late in the process, where they are far more costly to address.\u201d*\n\nSoftware and hardware teams must work together in tight collaboration throughout the development process to define market requirements, functional requirements, test cases and other artifacts that define the scope of what you\u2019re building are related in some fashion, either directly or indirectly. This becomes difficult when the teams use different tools and terminology, and work in different cadences with difference methodologies.\n\nAdopting these four best practices around modern requirements management and requirements traceability will help your team ensure product quality, decrease time-to-market, and achieve regulatory compliance.\n\n### 1. Connect stakeholders and contributors to the requirements they care about to ensure the right people can weigh in on important decisions at the right time.\n\nTraceable relationships are as much about connecting the people as they are about connecting the requirements themselves. Each requirement in the system has members of the team associated with it \u2014 analysts, architects, development, verification and quality assurance among them \u2014 and stakeholders and customers who care about its status. With connected relationships built into your project you can quickly get interested parties involved in decision making.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Building an Audit Trail Through Live Traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/building-an-audit-trail-through-live-traceability/)\n\n### 2. Automate bi-directional requirements traceability to minimize risk and ensure quality.\n\nManually updating an old-style traceability matrix is not only cumbersome and time consuming, it leaves open the risk for human error. In the development of safety-critical products like\u00a0[medical devices](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/medical-device/)\u00a0and\u00a0[airplanes](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/aerospace-defense/), this risk isn\u2019t acceptable. And it\u2019s difficult to prove to an auditor that you got it right.\n\nKey to managing requirements traceability is the ability to view source requirements and their related items downstream to lower-level requirements and then back to the source, and know the status of those items at each step of the product development process. Because this data may be stored in multiple systems, it\u2019s key to be able to connect tools via open APIs and automatically pull data into a single actionable system with visualized coverage of these trace relationships.\n\n### 3. Connect data, conversations, and decisions in a single system in the product development process.\n\nBeing able to visualize coverage of trace relationships is imperative. But what happens when you find a gap, or a test is failing? The ability to confer and collaborate with the people connected to the requirement right in the system allows you to capture decisions and actions and keep that information associated with the requirement. Down the road, if you need to revisit decisions, all data is stored and easy to find.\n\nWith this information managers can, for example, verify that their requirements are connected to downstream test cases and see what percentage of those tests have passed. In a system of action, every test case has a comment and activity stream accessible to all users. Testers and contributors can capture decisions, answer questions, and resolve issues transparently and responsively.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What are the benefits of end-to-end traceability in product development?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/what-are-the-benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability-in-product-development)\n\n### 4. Conduct formal reviews in compliance with internal controls or industry regulations with built-in reporting.\n\nIn the case of proving compliance with a set of rules and regulations, you need to show your requirements, their traceable connections to test plans, and verification that all test have passed. Using a requirements management solution that has built-in formal reviews and reporting for auditors makes this process less cumbersome and more reliable.\n\nTeams facing increasing complexity and pressure to comply with industry regulations must be able to search, track, and connect interdependent requirements. Achieving a faster time to market demands that teams collaborate quickly and effectively while they work on traceable requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What is Requirements Traceability and Why Does It Matter for Product Teams?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams)\n\n### In This Webinar, We Cover Best Practices for Requirements Traceability\n\nREQUIREMENTS TRACEABILITY\n\n**Requirements Traceability:** is the tracking of requirements throughout the product development lifecycle.\n\nPREVIOUSRequirements Traceability, What Are You Missing?\n\nNEXT UPRequirements Traceability: Links in the Chain\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

This becomes difficult when the teams use different tools and terminology, and work in different cadences with difference methodologies.\n\nAdopting these four best practices around modern requirements management and requirements traceability will help your team ensure product quality, decrease time-to-market, and achieve regulatory compliance.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "1.

In derived requirements traceability, teams will document the dependencies and logical links between these lower-level requirements and other system elements.\n\n### Derived Requirements, Explained\n\nFor sufficient derived requirements traceability, each requirement must have a unique and persistent label that allows for unambiguous tracking throughout the project. A centralized, modern requirements management solution is preferable to numerous discrete requirements documents for this purpose.\n\nNot only does such a management tool provide\u00a0[one convenient place for collecting feedback and collaborating in real time](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/)\u00a0on reviews and approvals, but it also supports live traceability of upstream and downstream relationships, with clear visibility into the impact of changes on all levels of requirements as well as test coverage. Accordingly, project teams can set up four distinct types of traceability links for their derived requirements.\n\n![Four types of requirements traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2013/01/fig-1-links-25.png)\n\nFigure 1. Four types of requirements traceability.\n\n### The Four Types of Derived Requirements Traceability\n\n#### 1. Forward to Requirements\n\nWhen customer needs evolve, requirements may have to be adjusted in response. By making these adjustments, project teams can keep pace with changes in customers priorities, introductions of new business rules, and modifications of existing rules, among other events.\n\n#### 2. Backward From Requirements\n\nTracking backward from requirements can provide clarity into the origin of each derived requirement. For instance, a requirements management tool could show the link between the derived requirement, the requirement it came from, and the customer use case being addressed.\n\n#### 3. Forward From Requirements\n\nOnce derived requirements begin flowing into downstream deliverables during product development, it\u2019s possible to draw trace relationships between requirements and their corresponding elements. This type of link provides assurance that every requirement is satisfied by a particular component.\n\n#### 4. Backward to Requirements\n\nFinally, this type of link allows for visibility into why certain features were created. Consider how most applications include lines of code that don\u2019t directly relate to stakeholder requirements. Even so, it is important to know why a software engineer wrote that code in the first place.\n\nWhile a full accounting of all four types is beyond the scope of this piece, let\u2019s look at a more in-depth example of the fourth type. Suppose a tester discovers unexpected functionality with no corresponding requirement. It could indicate two divergent possibilities:\n\n- The underlying code might have been implemented to meet a legitimate implied (derived) requirement, which could then be added to the requirements specification.\n- Alternatively, it might simply be orphan code that no longer belongs in the current product.\n\nTraceability links create clarity in such situations, shining a light on how the different pieces of a system all fit together. Conversely, test cases derived from \u2013 and traced back to \u2013 individual requirements offer a mechanism for detecting unimplemented requirements, because the tester won\u2019t find the expected functionality.\n\n![Some possible requirements traceability links.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2013/01/fig-2-links-25.png)\n\nFigure 2. Some possible requirements traceability links.\n\nThere are many types of traceability relationships possible within a project, and not all of them will be needed on every project. However, there are good motivations for implementing derived requirements traceability, via\u00a0[a best-in-breed solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/)\u00a0with flexibility that can be leveraged as needed for a given project.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices for Live Requirements Traceability](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/best-practices-for-requirements-traceability)\n\n### The Main Motivations for Derived Requirements Traceability\n\nAt a high level, traceability contributes to a more efficient product lifecycle and superior project management. More specific reasons for implementing it include:\n\n#### Certification\n\nTraceability data can support certification of safety-critical products, by demonstrating that all requirements were implemented.\n\n#### Impact analysis\n\nBy tracing derived requirements, it\u2019s less likely that something will be overlooked when determining the effects of changes to requirements.\n\n#### Maintenance\n\nClear traceability simplifies maintenance, as changes (e.g., in response to updates to government regulations or corporate policies) can be performed with more confidence. A modern requirements management tool makes it easier to show where each applicable rule was addressed in requirements.\n\n#### Project tracking\n\nTraceability information offers an accurate record of the implementation status of planned functionality, with missing links indicating work products not yet created.\n\n#### Reengineering\n\nList functions in a legacy system set for replacement and use traceability data to record where they were addressed in the new system\u2019s requirements and software components.\n\n#### Reuse\n\nWith derived requirements traceability in place, it\u2019s more practical to reuse product components by identifying packages of related requirements, designs, code, and tests.\n\n#### Risk reduction\n\nDocumenting component interconnections reduces risk in the event that a key team member with essential knowledge about the system departs the project.\n\n#### Testing\n\nThe links between requirements, tests, and code help indicate the likely locations of bugs when a test yields an unexpected result. Also, knowing which tests verify which requirements will save time by allowing for the elimination of redundant tests.\n\nThe\u00a0[second article in this series](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/links-in-the-requirements-chain-part-2)\u00a0discusses the requirements traceability matrix, and\u00a0[the final part](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/links-in-the-requirements-chain-part-3)\u00a0proposes a procedure for making requirements traceability work on your projects.\n\n### The purpose and importance of requirements traceability\n\nTraceability enables product teams to associate a specific requirement with all the related project artifacts, as well as other requirements, both forward and backward, so that anyone can see how the activity relates to the requirement\u2014and vice versa\u2014at any point during development. This functionality, also called live traceability, fosters team collaboration and enables early detection of possible production risks.\n\nThink of it this way: How important is it to have your products developed correctly in terms of definition, quality, and timing? Mission critical, right? That\u2019s why end-to-end traceability is so critical.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the\u00a0[benefits of traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability/)\u00a0throughout the product development lifecycle. For example, live traceability:\n\n- Simplifies project estimates\n- Enhances process visibility\n- Increases development efficiency\n- Improves impact analysis of change\n- Demonstrates verification and validation\n- Strengthens product quality\n- Proves compliance or functional safety\n\nA single line of sight on a requirement, or a\u00a0[digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), is supremely important for application lifecycle management (ALM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). Both endure tight timelines and increasing numbers of requirements \u2014 including those from regulations, where compliance is non-negotiable.\n\nKnowing the relationship between requirements, risk, tests, and so forth, is the difference between developing a compliant product on time and getting stuck in rework, delaying launches, and dealing with unhappy stakeholders. With requirements traceability, you don\u2019t have to compromise on speed or quality.\n\nThe bottom line is that end-to-end traceability confirms you\u2019re building the right thing and helps you prove compliance or functional safety. Without requirements traceability your development efficiency and product quality are in jeopardy.\n\n#### Forward and backward traceability: The mechanics of creating a digital thread\n\nTo connect all the phases of the product development lifecycle, from customer needs through support, four distinct kinds of links must be used to thread the process end-to-end. This includes high-level requirements as well as derived requirements\u2014those not specifically defined but necessary for meeting defined requirements or having the system work as expected. Derived requirements must also be adequately traced to reap the full benefits of live traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 What are you missing?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/requirements-traceability-what-are-you-missing)\n\n#### What is forward traceability?\n\nThere are two kinds of forward traceability: forward to requirements and forward from requirements. They both trace from an upstream component to downstream artifacts. The difference is in where they begin.\n\n**Forward to requirements**\u00a0traces from customer need to requirements. This is important because customer needs can evolve over time. If they do, requirements may need to change as a result. Following this type of forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes in priorities at any time throughout development.\n\n**Forward from requirements**\u00a0traces relationships between requirements and corresponding downstream artifacts, including test cases. This type of trace ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.\n\n![Traceability downstream](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/03/Traceability-Downstream-items-1-1024x533-1.png)\n\n#### What is backward traceability?\n\nLike forward traceability, there are two kinds of backward traceability. This pair traces from an endpoint, or downstream work product, to upstream elements. The two types of backward traceability have differing starting points.\n\n**Backward from requirements\u00a0**gives insight on how a requirement came to be by linking the requirement to the customer use case it addresses. This enables teams to improve decision making by understanding the origin of a requirement.\n\n**Backward to requirements\u00a0**begins at performed work and**\u00a0**traces to its requirement. It gives visibility into why specific items were created and how different pieces of a system fit together. Tracing in this way also allows testers to find gaps or missing requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [5 Ways Traceability Is Changing to Bolster the Remote Workforce](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/5-ways-traceability-is-changing-to-bolster-the-remote-workforce/)\n\n#### What is bidirectional traceability?\n\nBidirectional requirements traceability is the ability to perform both forward and backward traceability. Bidirectional traceability is the optimal type of traceability because it gives teams full visibility from requirements specifications through building, testing, changes, defects, and back again. Traceability of this caliber can only be achieved through automated requirements management tools, such as Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n![Traceability relationship map](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/03/Traceability-Relationship-map-1-1024x544-1.png)\n\n### Common challenges of requirements traceability\n\nIf all this sounds like traceability is too difficult, fear not. While there are[\u00a0some challenges to requirements traceability](https://web.archive.org/web/20180426111911/http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/702523/9188499/1288392919397/200907-Kannenberg.pdf?token=qsyKOWaIHYcXMnQDPg1NnxqYPa0%3D), there are also many templates and tools you can use to streamline the process (more on that below). For now, let\u2019s tackle some of the challenges so you can see how they can be overcome.\n\n##### Differing organizational viewpoints.\n\nNot everyone has the same understanding of why and how traceability should be performed. Stakeholders in sponsor or management positions may only view requirements traceability from a standard or regulatory perspective. They see it as a \u201cmust-have\u201d but may not understand the additional benefits of requirements traceability (as discussed above) in the way a project or systems engineer might.\n\nOne way to tackle this obstacle is to educate stakeholders on what can be achieved if end-to-end traceability is achieved. Share this article with everyone involved in your development process so they can have a basic understanding of why requirements traceability is an essential part of requirements management, beyond simply knowing they need it to cover their bases.\n\n##### Organization-wide adoption.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons a company might be slow to adopt traceability. Training is one such example. As considered regarding stakeholders, not all teams or individuals working on a project know why traceability is so crucial, or they simply may not know how to execute proper traceability correctly. Additionally, some people may be worried that traceability data from their decision points could come back to bite them.\n\nIf this is a challenge for your organization, again, education is imperative. But even beyond that, you need to create a culture in which traceability is seen as an inherent part of the development process. Start by creating clear policies regarding how the organization manages traceability. Then develop a positive training program for all new and existing employees to complete. If you choose a requirements management tool, make sure it has a strong track record of being\u00a0[intuitive and easy to use software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-names-jama-connect-winter-2021-leader-alm-software/)\u00a0that adapts to your process\u2014not the other way around.\n\n##### Cost of implementation.\n\nGetting an entire development organization on the same page regarding requirements traceability, then ensuring proper execution, can be a costly endeavor. The time spent developing policies, conducting training, and creating/maintaining traceability data add up and can even make folks feel less productive. Additionally, you may choose to adopt a traceability tool to streamline your process, which means upfront costs will be higher than previous projects.\n\nOvercoming this obstacle requires a mindset change. We urge you to consider the cost of doing nothing. Unproductive work time, lengthy time-to-market, rework, and defects are all extremely expensive symptoms of inadequate requirements traceability. Each of these carries a hefty price tag. For a look at exactly how much these complications could be costing your organization, check out the\u00a0[calculators on pages 9-11 in our Buyer\u2019s Guide](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tool). While there are costs to implementing requirements traceability and management tools, the amount saved throughout the development process far outweighs the short-term investment.\n\n##### Managing change.\n\nWhen building complex products, change is inevitable. It is essential that team members know about the changes and scope their impact across the product development lifecycle. That means looking closely at any related system requirements, downstream requirements, and verification tests that may be affected.\n\nPerforming this activity can be cumbersome and time consuming with manual requirements traceability tools. And the associated risks are similar to doing nothing, simply because you cannot be sure you\u2019ve accounted for everything when dealing with static documents and human error.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced this setback in your organization, it may be time to explore automated requirements management tools that enable [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Tips for Requirements Traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/better-product-development-tips-for-traceability/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\n##### Improper management tools.\n\nSome development teams are still tracing requirement relationships using Word or Excel documents and collaborating via email. A Requirements Traceability Matrix is one example of a document that manually traces elements of requirements management including, business requirements, objectives, design elements, and test cases via a spreadsheet. Teams input the list of requirements and fill in the related data. The spreadsheet is static but is updated manually by the team throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nThere can be advantages to using a Requirements Traceability Matrix if you are developing a product that doesn\u2019t have many requirements. And it is better than not tracing at all. You can even use a template to create a Requirements Traceability Matrix. However, if your product is complex, with many requirements, you\u2019ll likely experience many of the challenges discussed above.\n\nIn the case of complex products, a Requirements Traceability Matrix does not have the functionality you\u2019ll need to keep up with the pace of change and create a quality product in the timeframe required by stakeholders.\u00a0[Flexible requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-application-lifecycle-management-tools/)\u00a0like Jama Connect can even capture trace relationships across teams and toolsets, further enhancing the benefits of traceability.\n\n##### Insufficient compliance framework.\n\nRegulated industries need requirements management to demonstrate compliance with industry standards. There are specific ways reviewers and regulators must receive regulatory submissions. To pass an audit you must present proof of comprehensive traceability.\n\nIf comprehensive traceability wasn\u2019t performed throughout your development process, a lot of time will be committed to gathering the necessary information after the fact. Even if traceability was meticulously maintained in Word or Excel, there will still be time spent compiling it into an acceptable format for regulatory submission. In the meantime, competitors that make traceability inherent to their process will be first to market.\n\nSound familiar? Luckily, there are\u00a0[tools that perform end-to-end traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-ways-jama-makes-managing-traceability-easy/)\u00a0and come with frameworks aligned with industry standards.\u00a0[Requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/)\u00a0like Jama Connect simplify the audit process with export templates, thus speeding up the compliance presentation process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae Interchange\u2122: Live Traceability\u2122 Realized](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/jama-connect-interchange-live-traceability-realized)\n\n### Templates and tools to streamline the requirements traceability process\n\nThere are numerous tools available to assist with the traceability process.

Suppose a tester discovers unexpected functionality with no corresponding requirement. It could indicate two divergent possibilities:\n\nTraceability links create clarity in such situations, shining a light on how the different pieces of a system all fit together. Conversely, test cases derived from \u2013 and traced back to \u2013 individual requirements offer a mechanism for detecting unimplemented requirements, because the tester won\u2019t find the expected functionality.\n\n![Some possible requirements traceability links.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2013/01/fig-2-links-25.png)\n\nFigure 2.

This functionality, also called live traceability, fosters team collaboration and enables early detection of possible production risks.\n\nThink of it this way: How important is it to have your products developed correctly in terms of definition, quality, and timing? Mission critical, right? That\u2019s why end-to-end traceability is so critical.\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of the\u00a0[benefits of traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/benefits-of-end-to-end-traceability/)\u00a0throughout the product development lifecycle. For example, live traceability:\n\nA single line of sight on a requirement, or a\u00a0[digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/), is supremely important for application lifecycle management (ALM) and product lifecycle management (PLM). Both endure tight timelines and increasing numbers of requirements \u2014 including those from regulations, where compliance is non-negotiable.\n\nKnowing the relationship between requirements, risk, tests, and so forth, is the difference between developing a compliant product on time and getting stuck in rework, delaying launches, and dealing with unhappy stakeholders. With requirements traceability, you don\u2019t have to compromise on speed or quality.\n\nThe bottom line is that end-to-end traceability confirms you\u2019re building the right thing and helps you prove compliance or functional safety. Without requirements traceability your development efficiency and product quality are in jeopardy.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Forward and backward traceability: The mechanics of creating a digital thread", "level": 4, "content": "To connect all the phases of the product development lifecycle, from customer needs through support, four distinct kinds of links must be used to thread the process end-to-end. This includes high-level requirements as well as derived requirements\u2014those not specifically defined but necessary for meeting defined requirements or having the system work as expected. Derived requirements must also be adequately traced to reap the full benefits of live traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 What are you missing?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/requirements-traceability-what-are-you-missing)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is forward traceability?", "level": 4, "content": "There are two kinds of forward traceability: forward to requirements and forward from requirements.

Following this type of forward traceability enables teams to be informed of changes in priorities at any time throughout development.\n\n**Forward from requirements**\u00a0traces relationships between requirements and corresponding downstream artifacts, including test cases. This type of trace ensures that each requirement is not only satisfied but verified and validated.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is backward traceability?", "level": 4, "content": "Like forward traceability, there are two kinds of backward traceability.

Traceability of this caliber can only be achieved through automated requirements management tools, such as Jama Connect\u00ae.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Common challenges of requirements traceability", "level": 3, "content": "If all this sounds like traceability is too difficult, fear not. While there are[\u00a0some challenges to requirements traceability](https://web.archive.org/web/20180426111911/http://static1.1.sqspcdn.com/static/f/702523/9188499/1288392919397/200907-Kannenberg.pdf?token=qsyKOWaIHYcXMnQDPg1NnxqYPa0%3D), there are also many templates and tools you can use to streamline the process (more on that below). For now, let\u2019s tackle some of the challenges so you can see how they can be overcome.\n\nNot everyone has the same understanding of why and how traceability should be performed. Stakeholders in sponsor or management positions may only view requirements traceability from a standard or regulatory perspective. They see it as a \u201cmust-have\u201d but may not understand the additional benefits of requirements traceability (as discussed above) in the way a project or systems engineer might.\n\nOne way to tackle this obstacle is to educate stakeholders on what can be achieved if end-to-end traceability is achieved. Share this article with everyone involved in your development process so they can have a basic understanding of why requirements traceability is an essential part of requirements management, beyond simply knowing they need it to cover their bases.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons a company might be slow to adopt traceability. Training is one such example. As considered regarding stakeholders, not all teams or individuals working on a project know why traceability is so crucial, or they simply may not know how to execute proper traceability correctly. Additionally, some people may be worried that traceability data from their decision points could come back to bite them.\n\nIf this is a challenge for your organization, again, education is imperative. But even beyond that, you need to create a culture in which traceability is seen as an inherent part of the development process. Start by creating clear policies regarding how the organization manages traceability. Then develop a positive training program for all new and existing employees to complete. If you choose a requirements management tool, make sure it has a strong track record of being\u00a0[intuitive and easy to use software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-names-jama-connect-winter-2021-leader-alm-software/)\u00a0that adapts to your process\u2014not the other way around.\n\nGetting an entire development organization on the same page regarding requirements traceability, then ensuring proper execution, can be a costly endeavor. The time spent developing policies, conducting training, and creating/maintaining traceability data add up and can even make folks feel less productive. Additionally, you may choose to adopt a traceability tool to streamline your process, which means upfront costs will be higher than previous projects.\n\nOvercoming this obstacle requires a mindset change. We urge you to consider the cost of doing nothing. Unproductive work time, lengthy time-to-market, rework, and defects are all extremely expensive symptoms of inadequate requirements traceability. Each of these carries a hefty price tag. For a look at exactly how much these complications could be costing your organization, check out the\u00a0[calculators on pages 9-11 in our Buyer\u2019s Guide](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tool). While there are costs to implementing requirements traceability and management tools, the amount saved throughout the development process far outweighs the short-term investment.\n\nWhen building complex products, change is inevitable. It is essential that team members know about the changes and scope their impact across the product development lifecycle. That means looking closely at any related system requirements, downstream requirements, and verification tests that may be affected.\n\nPerforming this activity can be cumbersome and time consuming with manual requirements traceability tools. And the associated risks are similar to doing nothing, simply because you cannot be sure you\u2019ve accounted for everything when dealing with static documents and human error.\n\nIf you\u2019ve experienced this setback in your organization, it may be time to explore automated requirements management tools that enable [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Tips for Requirements Traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/better-product-development-tips-for-traceability/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\nSome development teams are still tracing requirement relationships using Word or Excel documents and collaborating via email. A Requirements Traceability Matrix is one example of a document that manually traces elements of requirements management including, business requirements, objectives, design elements, and test cases via a spreadsheet. Teams input the list of requirements and fill in the related data. The spreadsheet is static but is updated manually by the team throughout the development lifecycle.\n\nThere can be advantages to using a Requirements Traceability Matrix if you are developing a product that doesn\u2019t have many requirements. And it is better than not tracing at all. You can even use a template to create a Requirements Traceability Matrix. However, if your product is complex, with many requirements, you\u2019ll likely experience many of the challenges discussed above.\n\nIn the case of complex products, a Requirements Traceability Matrix does not have the functionality you\u2019ll need to keep up with the pace of change and create a quality product in the timeframe required by stakeholders.\u00a0[Flexible requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-application-lifecycle-management-tools/)\u00a0like Jama Connect can even capture trace relationships across teams and toolsets, further enhancing the benefits of traceability.\n\nRegulated industries need requirements management to demonstrate compliance with industry standards. There are specific ways reviewers and regulators must receive regulatory submissions. To pass an audit you must present proof of comprehensive traceability.\n\nIf comprehensive traceability wasn\u2019t performed throughout your development process, a lot of time will be committed to gathering the necessary information after the fact. Even if traceability was meticulously maintained in Word or Excel, there will still be time spent compiling it into an acceptable format for regulatory submission. In the meantime, competitors that make traceability inherent to their process will be first to market.\n\nSound familiar? Luckily, there are\u00a0[tools that perform end-to-end traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-ways-jama-makes-managing-traceability-easy/)\u00a0and come with frameworks aligned with industry standards.\u00a0[Requirements management tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/)\u00a0like Jama Connect simplify the audit process with export templates, thus speeding up the compliance presentation process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae Interchange\u2122: Live Traceability\u2122 Realized](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/jama-connect-interchange-live-traceability-realized)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Templates and tools to streamline the requirements traceability process", "level": 3, "content": "There are numerous tools available to assist with the traceability process.

Through end-to-end traceability, teams can see if a product\u2019s development process is currently on track, as well as view any and all of the history and context associated with it.\n\nThat\u2019s the ideal, at least.\n\n### Central benefits of implementing end-to-end traceability.\n\nLet\u2019s look at four central benefits of implementing end-to-end traceability with a solution like Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n#### 1. Holistic, Actionable Visibility into Requirements and Stakeholders\n\nTraceability is ultimately about relationships, not just between requirements and other artifacts, but between all of those items and the people responsible for managing them. With end-to-end traceability in place, teams can see:\n\n- How requirements trace\u00a0*forward*\u00a0to their implementations within work products, along with how those products trace\u00a0*back*\u00a0to original requirements and designs.\n- How all requirements were tested \u2013 i.e., the test cases linked to them, whether the tests passed or failed, and any associated defects identified along the way.\n- Who was involved in the development of specific requirements and test runs, so that they can be notified right away about necessary next steps or actions required.\n\nThis comprehensive visibility creates a system of action \u2013 one that teams can use to not only trace the life of each artifact but to initiate the appropriate activities to sustain product development and ensure coverage. Is a medical device safe to use? Does it comply with applicable standards? Can the processes used for building it stand up under an audit? A full-fledged traceability solution provides clear answers to these questions and others.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 What are you missing?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-traceability/requirements-traceability-what-are-you-missing)\n\n#### 2. Better Impact Analysis of Changes\n\nTruly informed impact analysis isn\u2019t possible without end-to-end traceability. That\u2019s because such analysis is rooted in being able to see how specific changes to an artifact will affect other items connected to it. Knowing those impacts requires traceability.\n\nIn traditional document-based workflows, it can be difficult to know how different items are affected by change. But in a platform with end-to-end traceability, much of this work is automated and becomes a byproduct of your daily work. The solution will instantly flag downstream links as \u201csuspect\u201d so that teams can attend to them as needed.\n\nFor example, teams can see if an altered requirement has test cases downstream and what share of them have passed \u2013 all in real time. This setup saves immense time and effort compared to manual processes.\n\n#### 3. Easier Identification of Gaps in Test Coverage\n\nSpeaking of tests, a requirement is typically only considered \u201ccovered\u201d if it has corresponding test cases against it, as well as test engineers assigned to it. But too often, gaps in coverage only become apparent after the fact, when a product issue reveals how a key flaw was overlooked during development.\n\nIn fields with rapid change and innovation, such as medical device development and automotive manufacturing, any unidentified coverage gaps are risky to end users and costly to remediate. Improved tracking of test coverage in a platform with end-to-end traceability helps eliminate these blind spots and ensure quality.\n\nMore specifically, this level of traceability within a requirements management solution helps test engineers and project managers visualize where gaps exist and whether tests have been approved, completed, rejected, or drafted. As a result, product development becomes less risky overall.\n\n#### 4. Simplified, More Accurate Audit Passage\n\n\u201cShow your work\u201d is a familiar adage to anyone who\u2019s completed a mathematics assignment, and it is crucial advice when tracing requirements, too. Passing an audit will require presenting specific information about those requirements, in formats acceptable to reviewers and regulators.\n\nA platform like Jama Connect simplifies this process by letting teams show clear supporting evidence of comprehensive traceability. It provides export templates like trace reports to provide this evidence, simplifying regulatory submissions and the audit process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [3 Ways Traceability Boosts Decision-Making and Accountability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/3-ways-traceability-boosts-decision-making-accountability/)\n\n### Where traceability can come up short \u2013 and how to fix it.\n\nTraditionally, traceability has been performed using document-based workflows involving applications such as Microsoft Word and Excel. A team member creates a traceability matrix in a text document or spreadsheet and updates it manually throughout the product development lifecycle. Unfortunately, this approach has distinct limitations and is prone to error.\n\nWhen teams trace requirements within discrete and static documents, they often create extra work for themselves, while also running the risk of missing out on critical updates or making mistakes.\n\nLet\u2019s say someone updates a matrix in Excel with the latest statuses of test cases related to a medical device that\u2019s in development. It might seem like everything is proceeding smoothly on the surface, but multiple problems could be lurking underneath:\n\n#### Human Error\n\nSince everything is done by hand, this individual must regularly revisit the matrix to keep it in sync and up to date with product development activities across the whole organization. The complexity of the traceability matrix in question \u2013 with its numerous tables showing how requirements and test cases connect to one another \u2013 makes such work inherently complicated and error-prone.\n\n#### Email-Centric Collaboration\n\nMeanwhile, these updates to the matrix are primarily communicated via email. Between the normal flow of messages into everyone\u2019s inboxes, people being out of the office, and other complications -like poor version control \u2013 and mishandling of incorporating everyone\u2019s comments, it is likely that errors will occur and misunderstanding will necessitate rework down the line.\n\n#### No Built-In Compliance\n\nFinally, even if everything goes according to plan, there\u2019s no guarantee that the traceability workflows in use will account for all relevant requirements and risks. For instance, in the case of a medical device, a matrix created within Excel won\u2019t come with frameworks aligned with industry standards like ISO 14971, making it more difficult to ensure coordinated traceability and ensure successful proof of compliance.\n\nFortunately, these types of issues don\u2019t have to hold your teams back and expose your product development processes to undue risk.

With a requirements management tool that captures everything from soft knowledge to regulatory compliance standards in real-time, product development teams can realize benefits such as faster speed of delivery, lower costs, and improved productivity.\n\n### Selecting the Right Requirements Management Tools and Software\n\nThere are many requirements management solutions on the market, but choosing the right one is critical for successful product development. Requirements are the foundation for creating products, systems, or software that meet standards for safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. These requirements must connect seamlessly across teams to ensure functionality and user satisfaction. For example, in [medical device development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/medical-device/), engineers, designers, software developers, and medical experts all bring unique requirements to the table. If these requirements don\u2019t align, the resulting product may fail to meet expectations.\n\nAs products, software, and regulatory guidelines grow more complex, traditional methods like static MS Word or Excel documents or using [Atlassian Jira alone](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/compare/jira-software/) are no longer sufficient. Teams are now [scattered across geographic boundaries](http://www.jamasoftware.com/collaboration/manage-development-complexities-across-hardware-and-software-teams), working remotely and asynchronously, while products increasingly require multidisciplinary expertise in areas like mechanics, electronics, software, green energy, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, organizations must capture both [hard knowledge and the soft experience](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/future-proof-product-development-process-with-the-right-technology/) of retiring workers while addressing the job mobility of younger generations.\n\nIn this dynamic environment, the need for modern requirements management tools has never been greater. Without a centralized solution, teams risk silos, delays, cost overruns, compliance gaps, and product defects. The right requirements management tool streamlines collaboration, preserves knowledge, and helps teams deliver better products to market faster, ensuring they stay competitive in an Agile-driven world.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)\n\n### What criteria should be used to select requirements management tools?\n\nTo some degree, it depends on the industry, product, and make-up of your team. Ask yourself some of the following questions:\n\n#### Is the requirements management software collaborative?\n\nIf your teams are scattered, implementing\u00a0[a solution that allows for structured collaboration](http://www.jamasoftware.com/collaboration/guide-to-optimizing-engineering-team-collaboration) and accommodates everyone is vital. A collaborative solution also facilitates a move to Agile.\n\n#### What is the best tool to manage requirements for complex products in regulated industries?\n\nIn general, the more complex the product, the more robust the solution needs to be. Highly regulated industries need requirements management tools that allow them to trace compliance-related requirements in real-time.\n\n#### How important isLive Traceability\u2122?\n\nIf your requirements management tool or system fails to address a fragmented development life cycle, the likelihood and risk of negative outcomes increases. Live Traceability\u00a0delivers significant productivity improvements, and dramatically reduces the risk of product delays, cost overruns, defects, rework, and recalls resulting in faster time to market.\n\n#### Are we stuck, unproductive, or frequently bogged down in a way that delays the release of products?\n\nThe right requirements management tool can streamline your processes and get the team moving in the right direction.\n\n#### Do we need our requirements management tool to connect with other tools?\n\nMany cloud-based requirements management solutions offer integrations with other cloud-based tools to further streamline your product development process and allow better collaboration across ecosystems.\n\n#### What is the difference between using a spreadsheet and requirements management tools to manage requirements?\n\nUsing a Microsoft Word document or a spreadsheet for requirements management isn\u2019t necessarily wrong. For simple products with small, in-house development teams and few governing regulatory guidelines, a spreadsheet may suffice. Historically, requirements have been captured using spreadsheets or simple word processor documents.\n\n#### What are the pros and cons of using an MS Word document or spreadsheets for managing requirements?\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0**\u00a0Pros:\u00a0**Simple; cost-effective with free or open-source spreadsheet apps; few barriers to adoption.\n\n\u00b7 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0**\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bCons:\u00a0**Prone to errors; tracking change is difficult; may not be easy to collaborate.\n\nAs products and regulations become more complex, [the spreadsheet approach creates obstacles](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/why-choose-jama-connect-over-word-and-excel/)\u00a0and hinders traceability. Teams increasingly work across a variety of geographies, disciplines, functions, and even companies. As the importance of cross-boundary collaboration rises and teams work in-person less frequently, trying to maintain one spreadsheet becomes increasingly difficult. Even a shared document on a cloud drive is inadequate; it may be infrequently updated, saved on multiple drives, or full of insufficient information. In addition, especially on multi-disciplinary teams, members may find a spreadsheet cumbersome as they try to determine which requirements they are directly responsible to address. Finally, creating a requirements trace matrix from a spreadsheet can be cumbersome and prone to incomplete information.\n\nAt the point where a spreadsheet is no longer adequate to trace and track requirements, organizations and teams need to consider what type of dedicated requirements management solution will work for them. A dedicated tool should allow the product development team to collaborate across boundaries, easily trace requirements, and produce requirements documentation with ease.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

SMBs may want to look for a tool that has a lower-priced edition or a per-user pricing model. Those options can still provide the important functions of requirements traceability, integrated discussion boards, and collaboration while remaining cost-effective.\n\nFor highly regulated industries, a\u00a0[robust RM tool](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/three-reasons-you-need-a-requirements-management-solution/)\u00a0can significantly reduce the risk of product failures, recalls, and reprimands from regulatory agencies. With a requirements tool that captures everything in one place, teams operate with more complete information and generate more accurate reports, which reduces the\u00a0[risk of product failure](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/risk-management/).\n\nFor the enterprise, a requirements management platform that offers full integration and collaboration options can help keep teams agile in a start-up world. In addition, the right requirements solution makes integrating market research and user stories easier, improving the chances of successful product release.\n\nYour requirements management system should, at the very least, do these things:\n\n- Minimize the effort required to achieve compliance with regulatory standards\n- Reduce risk and the impact of change\n- Enable alignment and collaboration across teams and activities\n- Provide end-to-end visibility and control with a single source of truth\n\n### What are the pros and cons of requirements management tools?\n\nFor teams working on complex products in a regulated industry (especially those with a widely distributed team), there are many pros to adopting a dedicated requirements management tool. With the right tool, teams can realize several advantages:\n\n**Improved productivity:\u00a0**With one dedicated solution, team members have a single source of truth. As members write requirements, add user stories, trace progress, link to other layers of knowledge, and create relationships with other requirements, everyone on the team can see how decisions and progress ripple across the product development lifecycle.\n\n**Reduced time to market:**\u00a0With improved productivity comes reduced time to market. With true collaboration inside a requirements management solution, traceability improves, and all stakeholders can see connections in real-time.\n\n**Reduced rework:\u00a0**A\u00a0[2018 Engineering.com study](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/design-teams-requirements-management-product-complexity)\u00a0(sponsored by Jama Software) revealed that 83% of design teams experienced some kind of production outcome failure due to poor requirements management. Improving requirements management along the way will reduce potential rework, thereby improving outcomes.\n\n**Reduced defects:\u00a0**Defects in the development process are common, but they don\u2019t have to result in long-term problems if caught early. Proper requirements management can help quickly identify defects and track their impact. By giving visibility into the problem early, teams can address and correct defects before they result in product failure or regulatory problems.\n\nOf course, there are downsides to some requirements management tools. Some solutions may be cost-prohibitive. If the solution isn\u2019t user-friendly, teams may be reluctant to adopt it, especially if the customer support isn\u2019t outstanding. Additionally, teams may use different apps or solutions that lack integration capabilities, creating barriers to productivity, collaboration, and, ultimately, product releases.\n\n#### What features are important for requirements management software?\n\nRequirements Management includes the ability to define requirements, model relationships, link requirements, reuse requirements, and export/import requirements data.\n\nJama Software breaks down some of the key features of various requirements management solutions on the market and shows what top requirements management tools have in common.\n\nThere is a wide range of features offered across requirements management solutions. The features highlighted focus on the core functionality that any solution must offer to effectively fulfill the function of requirements management.\n\n### Top Requirements Management Tools Have These Things in Common\n\n**Ease of Use**\u00a0\u2013 installation and implementation must not take a lot of time and must quickly integrate with other systems and workflows to ensure adoption of the solution across teams.\n\n**Collaboration and Reviews**\u00a0\u2013 \u00a0includes the functionality for interaction between users, as well as some basic task management functionalities to allow for collaboration on tasks. This includes the ability to review, approve, provide electronic signatures, gather input, maintain version control, and receive notifications about other users\u2019 activity within the software. This may extend to include collaboration with external teams and suppliers.\n\n**Full\u00a0****Traceability and Impact Analysis\u00a0**\u2013 able to establish an automatic relationship across requirements is key to effective requirements management. This includes[\u00a0test management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/)\u00a0and the ability to run test cases and mitigate risks through change management across the lifecycle of a project.\n\n**Flexible, Scalable Architecture**\u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0customers are searching for flexible, scalable and secure deployment models \u00a0with simplified, yet flexible license types for uses to support role-based deployment. These options should include availability as a SaaS solution in the Cloud or offered on-premises.\n\n**Integrations**\u00a0\u2013 the ability to integrate easily with other systems that are being used by the company. \u00a0Additionally, the solution should include an API built for customization and integrations to best-of-breed solutions across the customer\u2019s tool ecosystem. Some integrations to look for are for software development tools, automated testing tools, and design and modeling tools.\n\n**Reporting and Analytics \u2013\u00a0**graphical tools and reports, interactive flows and simulations, dashboards, storyboards, and functionality for graphical models.\n\nTools on the market to fill the function of requirements management vary from [MS Word](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/why-choose-jama-connect-over-word-and-excel/) to those that focus on a specific industry use case (e.g. Greenlight Guru), all the way to full-scale Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tools (e.g. Modern Requirements4DevOps, [Intland Software codeBeamer ALM](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/why-choose-jama-connect-over-codebeamer/)) and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) tools that serve multiple lifecycle needs (e.g. [Siemens Polarion and PolarionX](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/choosing-jama-connect-over-polarion/), IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management,\u00a0IBM Rational, [IBM DOORS](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/better-than-ibm-doors/) Family and [IBM Next](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/why-choose-jama-connect-over-ibm-doors-next/), Rational DOORS, PTC Windchill, Dassault Systems Reqtify) to\u00a0[fit-for-purpose requirements management tools, focusing on the discipline of requirements management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-management/)\u00a0(e.g. Jama Connect).\n\nLearn from customers directly how the products compare on leading customer review sites like\u00a0[G2\u00a0](https://www.jamasoftware.com/resource/whitepaper/jama-connect-continues-to-lead-the-way-in-requirements-management/)and\u00a0[TrustRadius](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/jama-connect-named-as-the-2025-trustradius-top-rated-winner-in-requirements-management/).\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Perform Better Impact Analysis on Upstream and Downstream Relationships](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-functional-requirement-vs-non-functional-requirements/)\n\n#### Team Culture and the Right RM Solution: Paired for Success\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the right software can only do so much. Ultimately, a requirements management tool is just that \u2014 a tool. The right tool, however, can go a long way toward encouraging team cohesion and success, especially in an agile project. Look for a requirements management solution that:\n\n**Captures a full range of knowledge from all users:\u00a0**With an increasingly mobile workforce, it\u2019s more important than ever to capture knowledge and hold onto it when workers move on. The right requirements management tool can help. As users enter and track requirements, knowledge is saved in one central location, allowing future users to access that knowledge for future projects.\n\n**Encourages collaboration and allows all users visibility:\u00a0**While it may be necessary to limit who can actually make changes to requirements, the right tool should give all team members the ability to see up-to-date information. This gives everyone a sense of connection to the project and allows users to see the impact of requirements and changes to all steps of the design process.\n\n**Provides a top-notch customer experience:\u00a0**A solution that gives you a full range of training options and ongoing support will help all members of your team adopt your solution. An added bonus is a strong user community that can offer support and advice from colleagues.\n\nThe right requirements management solution can give your product design team a way to manage, change, and track requirements through the full development life cycle and improve your chances of a successful product launch.

Requirements are the foundation for creating products, systems, or software that meet standards for safety, reliability, and customer satisfaction. These requirements must connect seamlessly across teams to ensure functionality and user satisfaction. For example, in [medical device development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/medical-device/), engineers, designers, software developers, and medical experts all bring unique requirements to the table. If these requirements don\u2019t align, the resulting product may fail to meet expectations.\n\nAs products, software, and regulatory guidelines grow more complex, traditional methods like static MS Word or Excel documents or using [Atlassian Jira alone](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/compare/jira-software/) are no longer sufficient. Teams are now [scattered across geographic boundaries](http://www.jamasoftware.com/collaboration/manage-development-complexities-across-hardware-and-software-teams), working remotely and asynchronously, while products increasingly require multidisciplinary expertise in areas like mechanics, electronics, software, green energy, and artificial intelligence. Additionally, organizations must capture both [hard knowledge and the soft experience](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/future-proof-product-development-process-with-the-right-technology/) of retiring workers while addressing the job mobility of younger generations.\n\nIn this dynamic environment, the need for modern requirements management tools has never been greater. Without a centralized solution, teams risk silos, delays, cost overruns, compliance gaps, and product defects. The right requirements management tool streamlines collaboration, preserves knowledge, and helps teams deliver better products to market faster, ensuring they stay competitive in an Agile-driven world.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Evaluating Requirements Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/evaluating-requirements-management-tools/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What criteria should be used to select requirements management tools?", "level": 3, "content": "To some degree, it depends on the industry, product, and make-up of your team.

Teams increasingly work across a variety of geographies, disciplines, functions, and even companies. As the importance of cross-boundary collaboration rises and teams work in-person less frequently, trying to maintain one spreadsheet becomes increasingly difficult. Even a shared document on a cloud drive is inadequate; it may be infrequently updated, saved on multiple drives, or full of insufficient information. In addition, especially on multi-disciplinary teams, members may find a spreadsheet cumbersome as they try to determine which requirements they are directly responsible to address. Finally, creating a requirements trace matrix from a spreadsheet can be cumbersome and prone to incomplete information.\n\nAt the point where a spreadsheet is no longer adequate to trace and track requirements, organizations and teams need to consider what type of dedicated requirements management solution will work for them. A dedicated tool should allow the product development team to collaborate across boundaries, easily trace requirements, and produce requirements documentation with ease.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Ready to Find Out More?", "level": 3, "content": "Our team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

SMBs may want to look for a tool that has a lower-priced edition or a per-user pricing model. Those options can still provide the important functions of requirements traceability, integrated discussion boards, and collaboration while remaining cost-effective.\n\nFor highly regulated industries, a\u00a0[robust RM tool](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/three-reasons-you-need-a-requirements-management-solution/)\u00a0can significantly reduce the risk of product failures, recalls, and reprimands from regulatory agencies. With a requirements tool that captures everything in one place, teams operate with more complete information and generate more accurate reports, which reduces the\u00a0[risk of product failure](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/risk-management/).\n\nFor the enterprise, a requirements management platform that offers full integration and collaboration options can help keep teams agile in a start-up world.

With the right tool, teams can realize several advantages:\n\n**Improved productivity:\u00a0**With one dedicated solution, team members have a single source of truth. As members write requirements, add user stories, trace progress, link to other layers of knowledge, and create relationships with other requirements, everyone on the team can see how decisions and progress ripple across the product development lifecycle.\n\n**Reduced time to market:**\u00a0With improved productivity comes reduced time to market. With true collaboration inside a requirements management solution, traceability improves, and all stakeholders can see connections in real-time.\n\n**Reduced rework:\u00a0**A\u00a0[2018 Engineering.com study](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/design-teams-requirements-management-product-complexity)\u00a0(sponsored by Jama Software) revealed that 83% of design teams experienced some kind of production outcome failure due to poor requirements management. Improving requirements management along the way will reduce potential rework, thereby improving outcomes.\n\n**Reduced defects:\u00a0**Defects in the development process are common, but they don\u2019t have to result in long-term problems if caught early. Proper requirements management can help quickly identify defects and track their impact. By giving visibility into the problem early, teams can address and correct defects before they result in product failure or regulatory problems.\n\nOf course, there are downsides to some requirements management tools. Some solutions may be cost-prohibitive. If the solution isn\u2019t user-friendly, teams may be reluctant to adopt it, especially if the customer support isn\u2019t outstanding.

Making strategic changes that optimize processes and team productivity will undoubtedly save your organization significant time and money.\n\nAnd, while it may seem counter-intuitive to invest in new technology during an economic downturn (dare we say the word recession), a modern requirements management tool like Jama Connect\u00ae, can provide a dramatic ROI in short order \u2014 making it a smart-sense move to invest in new product development software right now.\n\nDuring economic downturns, spending capital on the right tools now will well-position your organization to save time and money, improve product quality, and increase productivity over the long term. But regardless of what happens with the economy, it is never going to be wasted effort to optimize your product development processes or begin to think about how to weather the impact of an impending economic storm.\n\n### Invest Now to Save In Both the Short and Long Term\n\nMany of our clients come to Jama Software to help optimize their product development process after experiencing some of the following core frustrations:\n\n- Using cumbersome legacy requirements management solutions that have non-intuitive challenging UI/UX\n- Engineers spending valuable hours of tedious manual documentation across disparate documents and tools\n- Engineers wasting time on in-efficient workflows that can be streamlined to save upwards of 80%\n- Insufficient, ineffective cross-team collaboration across various stages of the systems development process starting from requirements, design, development to testing and validation\n- Inefficient and cumbersome review cycles\n- Difficulty in easily producing the necessary documentation to prove compliance\n- Siloed tools and processes that misalign teams and workflows, and leave visibility gaps\n- Lack of [Live Traceability\u2122](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/requirements-traceability) which results in finding errors late in the development process which can cost upwards of 100x or more to resolve than if they had been found earlier in the development process\n\nThink about the corresponding monetary burden these outdated solutions and misaligned processes place on the organization\u2019s shoulders.\n\nMaking an investment in a modern requirements management platform isn\u2019t simply about the time and money that will be saved or improving productivity and efficiency for just a few months \u2014 it\u2019s about the savings and reduced re-work that will be realized from the moment the application launches and for years beyond. Depending on the organization\u2019s goals, they either save costs with the gained efficiencies or they use it to be competitive, win new contracts, and bring products to market faster and more cost effectively. You may be thinking that now is the time to pause on spending, not invest. To the contrary, we\u2019d like to share how investing in a modern requirements management solution now is the right decision to help your organization protect itself from an economic downturn and increase your ROI.\n\n### For Startups: Build Your House on Bricks, Not Sticks\n\nFor startups, investing in a modern requirements management solution, like Jama Connect, is a smart idea irrespective of the state of the economy.\n\nWhile long established large organizations may be able to withstand a period of lowered sales and slow development, startups may not have that option. A startup\u2019s ability to get to market fast \u2013 and first \u2013 often is a great indicator of success, and on the flip side, failure.\n\nDoing things right the first time is crucial.\n\nWhile startups might be hesitant to invest in software initially, a great number are investing in Jama Connect in order to reduce rework, speed development, meeting regulatory compliance, and get to the market before their competitors.\n\nAnd it\u2019s paying off.\n\nFor [medical device startup, Proprio](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/jama-software-proprio-customer-story), VP of Software Engineering, Rama Pailoor knew it was imperative to establish a requirements-driven development process from the very beginning. Pailoor recognized that their existing approach of using only a Quality Management System (QMS) was not capable of supporting the level of complexity needed to develop their product. Like many document and spreadsheet-based processes, the Quality Management System (QMS) Proprio had in place technically supported requirements management at face value, but when it came to complex engineering efforts, the system came up short.\n\n> \u201cEstablishing a requirements-driven development process helps to formalize the user needs, getting all the stakeholders to come to a common forum, to express the requirements from their perspective, and avoid confusion. The right requirements management solution can facilitate all of that.\u201d\n> Rama Pailoor\n> Vice President of Software Engineering\n> Proprio\n\n### For medium to large organizations: Strengthen your foundation by investing in modern tools and digital transformation\n\nWhile big enterprises have large teams spread across various geographies and different divisions working on multiple projects, there is a strong need to optimize processes and reduce inefficiencies to reduce costs \u2014 especially during challenging economic times. Putting resources towards digital transformation and modern software tools (which result in more ROI) will also reduce overall product development costs over the long term. Through these investments, companies can strengthen their foundation to remain competitive and be better able to weather external market forces.\n\nIt is also worth re-visiting how enterprises can improve the engineering efficiency of product development by investing in requirements management and traceability tools. Optimizing the systems engineering process by bringing in traceability across your development stages can immediately create a positive impact on cycle times, and faster execution of testing and validation.\n\n### Eight Ways Modern Requirements Management Software Will Save You Significant Money\n\n#### 1: Reclaiming Productive Work Time\n\nA modern requirements management solution like Jama Connect can help your teams reclaim hours of unproductive work time, resulting in money saved across the organization. Without a modern requirements management solution, highly skilled \u2013 and often highly paid \u2013 employees can waste up to 40% of their time on tedious, unproductive activities such as:\n\n- Searching for siloed information in static documents and/or disconnected tools\n- Manual/or duplicative data entry to update status in multiple systems\n- Working off old data and outdated versions of documents\n- Reformatting and migrating data back and forth between tools\n- Reconciling differences between data sources\n- Trying to understand \u2018what changed?\u2019 and assess the impact\n\nAfter implementing Jama Connect, our customers on average, quantify that they are reclaiming one to two hours of productive work time per day, some even more. The engineers at [Monolithic Power Systems](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/automotive/jama-software-mps-customer-story) can now quickly and easily produce required documentation and no longer need to spend time in multiple time-consuming meetings and scrums to get a clear picture of what\u2019s happening with their products. And with Jama Connect, they can automatically generate \u2014 at times \u2014 70-80 pages of documentation (entered correctly one time, in one place) and efficiently generate any additional documentation they need, saving their engineers countless hours of documentation time.\n\nAnother customer, [RBC Medical Innovations](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/streamlining-workflow-and-strengthening-collaboration-when-developing-medical-devices) **[now known as Vantage Medtech]** shared that on one of their state-of-the-art capital equipment development projects, Jama Connect saved them 123 team-member days with an average cost savings per project of $150,000. And medical industry innovators and pioneers in the field of plasma science, [Grifols](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/healthcare-leader-grifols-uses-jama-connect-to-cut-costs-and-speed-development), reports saving 80 hours or more per project after implementing Jama Connect.\n\nInterested in the numbers?\n\nLet\u2019s take, for example, this simple calculation.\n\nIf you have 10 team members engaged in core requirements management activities, and each spend roughly four hours on the above-listed unproductive tasks per weeks, the annual budget reclaimed with Jama Connect would be $94,118.\n\n*Note: The calculation assumes 237 actual working days per year (at an average salary of $100K) with each author in Jama Connect reclaiming a conservative one hour per day.*\n\n*Test this out with your own numbers using our interactive calculator!*\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/interactive-content/reclaiming-productive-work-time-roi-calculator)\n\n#### 2: Reducing Rework\n\nHow much money are you leaving on the table due to rework? See how much you can save by decreasing discovered and unplanned work due to:\n\n- Improperly defined requirements\n- Incomplete decomposition and missing coverage\n- Insufficient review and stakeholder alignment\n- Lack of rigor and impact analysis when managing change\n- Late-stage requirements churn\n\nAgain, let\u2019s assume an organization has an average product development investment cost of $10,000,000. (Typical rework costs average about 30% of development costs, so in this case, it would be $3,000,000. And rework costs due to poor requirements management averages about 60% of rework costs, which, in this case would be $1,800,000).\n\n**Our customer data shows that Jama Connect typically reduces requirements management rework by 40-60%.** So, with these calculations, the organization can expect to reclaim, a not insignificant, $900,000 of annual budget with Jama Connect.\n\nIn one example our customer, [Arteris IP](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/see-how-innovator-arteris-ip-is-leveraging-jama-connect-for-autonomous-vehicle-development) has seen not only seen reuse go up by 100%, and review times down by 30%, but also a significant **50% reduction** in rework since using Jama Connect.\n\n*Test this out with your own numbers using our interactive calculator!*\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/interactive-content/reclaiming-productive-work-time-roi-calculator)\n\n#### 3: Streamlining the Review Process\n\nFor product developers and engineers, reviews are a cornerstone of the development process. How much are inefficient requirement review meetings costing your organization? Is your review process cumbersome, manual, in disparate documents, and challenging for distributed stakeholders to collaborate? If so, it might be time to (forgive the redundancy) review your review process. Healthcare leader, Grifols shared that with Jama Connect, they have reduced their review cycles from three months to fewer than 30 days.\n\nLegacy solutions that are difficult to use, can make the review process incredibly cumbersome, diverting frustrated team members out of the tool and onto ineffective (often quickly outdated) versions of disparate documents. This is a story we\u2019ve heard repetitively from customers who\u2019ve moved away from legacy tools and processes.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Why Migrate from IBM\u00ae DOORS\u00ae to Jama Connect\u00ae?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/better-than-ibm-doors/)\n\nIf that\u2019s one of your frustrations as well, it might be time to see how much budget you can reclaim through review optimization, including:\n\n- Virtualizing reviews for asynchronous collaboration\n- Focusing key stakeholders on the most relevant information\n- Adopting a more iterative approach\n- Increasing upfront rigor and version control\n- Tracking participation and progress\n\nFor this calculation we\u2019ll assume three variables:\n\n1. Total number of requirements review meetings per month\n2. Approximate duration of each review meeting\n3. Average participants in each meeting\n\nLet\u2019s assume six review meetings per month, each meeting lasting three hours, and an average of 10 people involved in each review meeting. Calculating with an average salary of $150K/per attendee, and with the above defined variables, the annual cost of review meetings would be $162,000. The total number of people hours in review meetings would be 180 hours.\n\nThe calculated savings alone, by just reducing the time spent in meetings, would be $81,000.\n\n**Jama Connect typically reduces time spent in meetings by 40-60%. Notably, the Finnish Red Cross estimates that implementing Jama Connect has shortened their review cycles by an impressive 80%. What could you get done with all that time back?**\n\nWith Jama Connect, you can simplify the review and approval process by capturing collaborative feedback from stakeholders, including voting for priority and electronic signatures for approver roles. In addition, Review Center in Jama Connect helps teams reduce risk, and save time and money by allowing teams to:\n\n- Increase participation in the review process\n- Retain an historical record of all decisions made and by whom\n- Provide visibility sooner in the review process\n- Generate approval-ready content for e-signature faster\n- Collaborate more often and capture tacit knowledge\n\n*Test this out with your own numbers using our interactive calculator!*\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/interactive-content/improving-the-review-process-roi-calculator)\n\n#### 4: Identifying Defects Earlier in the Development Process\n\nDoes your organization build complex software and systems? How much can you decrease the cost of development by addressing software defects earlier? Using a modern requirements management solution can help you identify and address software defects due to:\n\n- Lack of rigor early in the development lifecycle\n- Low stakeholder participation in requirements definition/validation\n- Poor visibility into requirements changes and impact analysis\n- V&V/QA teams remaining disconnected throughout the process\n\nFor this sample equation, we\u2019ll take an average total number of requirements managed annually (we\u2019ll use 4,500) and the average number of hours it takes to fix a defect (we\u2019ll use six hours for this example). The average number of requirements with defects typically equals around 60% of the total number of requirements. With these test numbers, the annual cost of defects would be $850,000. Jama Connect can reduce the number of requirements-related defects by 25-40%. Identifying and addressing these issues earlier in the development process can significantly help to reduce risk and reclaim significant budget.\n\n*For this calculation, we\u2019ve used 30%. The calculation assumes 237 actual working days per year (at an average salary of $100K) with each author in Jama Connect reclaiming one hour per day.*\n\n**With Jama Connect, the annual budget that could be reclaimed is $255,150.**\n\n*Test the numbers for yourself using this ROI calculator to see how much you can save by reducing requirements-related defects by up to 40%!*\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/interactive-content/identify-defects-early-roi-calculator)\n\n#### 5: Providing a Better User Experience\n\nLet\u2019s face it, if software is difficult to use and the user interface is challenging, engineers just won\u2019t use it, or only a select few will. We all want life to get the job done, run smoothly and easily \u2014 and the software we choose needs to reflect those desires. So, a requirements management tool not only needs to be powerful and have robust capabilities, but it needs to be easy to use.\n\n> \u201cJama Connect lowers the complexity and burden of having to\u202fmanually keep requirements, architecture, and specifications all in\u202fsync and traced to each other.\u202f It\u2019s a formidable problem that is\u202fvirtually eliminated courtesy of Jama without the hassle of having to\u202flearn a clunky UI (IBM Doors).\u201d\n> Alan M.\n> Chief Product Officer\n> G2 Verified Review\n\n> \u201cJama is being used as a test management tool in my company. I [have been] using Jama [for] 3+ years, and I can tell you that this was one of the best Test management tools I\u2019ve ever used. Everything is so easy to understand, and the interface is user friendly \u2014 easy to use and can learn this tool quickly.\u201d\n> Team Lead in Engineering\n> Software Company\n> Verified Trust Radius Review\n\nA smooth user experience that provides a pleasant and recognizable interface (one that teams will actually use) is critical to the success and effectiveness of any product development process. Jama Connect is award winning for its ease of use, and that\u2019s something we\u2019re proud of. Customers love using Jama Connect to optimize their complex product, systems, and software development spanning industries such as aerospace and defense, automotive, medical device/life sciences, financial, semiconductor, insurance, industrial, software technologies, and more.\n\n> \u201cOur team cannot stop saying great things about Jama Connect! Its efficiency and intuitiveness have turned requirement workshops from a multi-day event to a 6-hour meeting. Teams adopted the platform so fast, we needed to go back to Jama to get additional licenses (twice)!\u201d\n> Jim Bolton\n> Director of Methodology and Tools\n> Workforce Software\n\n> \u201cI told the team it was a very easy-to-use solution. But people were shocked at how fast it came together. Within hours, we were going and setting up the structure for our requirements. There were many other people in the company who had used Jama Connect before and supported our selection. It was a clear choice for medical device innovators like us.\u201d\n> Rama Pailoor\n> Vice President of Software Engineering\n> Proprio\n\n#### 6: Optimizing Communication and Collaboration\n\nModern, easy-to-use software can improve collaboration and communication across an organization, both for internal and external stakeholders. The right requirements management software will optimize communication and save money, frustration, resources, and time- across the board. One of our customers, the [Finnish Red Cross](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/jama-software-finnish-red-cross-customer-story), estimates that their testing team has improved their collaboration and communication by 50% with Jama Connect.\n\nLegacy systems like IBM\u00ae DOORS\u00ae are notoriously difficult to use and often require individuals with specialized training to implement. This regularly forces engineers and other stakeholders to manage projects outside the software in disparate documents.\n\n> \u201cJama suited our need for collaboration and communication. Jama provides a very easy-to-use interface and communication system that brought in the buy-in\u202ffrom all stakeholders. Visure, Doors, TTA didn\u2019t perform as well in\u202fthe communication/\u202fcollaboration department where we really needed\u202fa boost.\u201d\n> Stephen Czerniej\n> P. Eng, Systems Engineer\n> Allied Vision\n\nWith Jama Connect, broader teams and stakeholders can collaborate on reviews, test cases, verification and validation in real time. This kind of in-situ collaboration dramatically reduces risk across the entire development lifecycle to reduce the chance of delays, cost overruns, and expensive recalls, and in turn increases the opportunity for successful outcomes.\n\n> [Jama Connect] has allowed us to get more people from our other offices involved in the collaboration process because we\u2019re not all having to sit on a conference call at awkward times. People can come into the system at a time that suits them and review things. And we know their comments will be seen by everybody else.\u201d\n> Alistair McBain\n> Sr. Business Consultant\n> SITA\n\n> \u201cThe fact that it is easy to share information and execute processes even when the team is not co-located (geographically dispersed). Changes are properly tracked, and people notified. It is also easy to organize, review, and monitor the review progress. My organization involves several scientists from 31 countries and more than 200 institutes. Jama Connect gets remote and distributed people informed and involved on processes related to requirements.\u201d\n> Francesco D.\n> Senior Systems Engineer\n> Verified G2 Review\n\n#### 7: Centralizing Your Requirements Management with Best-of-Breed Tooling\n\nManaging requirements in a single platform speeds up the product development process by saving time (time=money), strengthening alignment, and ensuring quality and compliance. Teams can create, review, validate, and verify requirements in one solution. With Jama Connect, teams can:\n\n- Have an authoritative source of truth for clear visibility throughout the product development lifecycle\n- Iterate in real time for informed decision making and consensus\n- Support multiple product development methodologies and engineering disciplines\n- Configure the requirements management software to align to\u202findustry best practices\n- Visualize how\u202ftests track back to requirements\u202fto prove quality and compliance\n- Reuse validated requirements to quickly replicate features across products\n- Not investigating how you can leverage software within your organization is costing you money\n\n> \u201cWe are using [Jama Connect] from the design specifications/requirements till the test case reviews\u2026since Jama can be used as a complete project management tool, complete details of a product /project can be tracked in one place easily.\u201d\n> Suhas Kashyap\n> Senior Test Engineer\n> L&T Technology Services\n> TrustRadius Verified Review\n\n> \u201cJama Connect has brought some new life to our requirements management (and how we see the inter-connectivity of functional requirements with System Requirement Specifications), better dashboards and reporting for everything it supports from printing test plans, requirements, specifications, and test runs.\u201d\n> Fred Sookiasian\n> Senior Quality Assurance Software Lead\n> Advanced Bionics\n\n##### The #1 problem product engineering organizations face is complying with traceability requirements spanning siloed teams and tools. And one dirty little secret in product engineering is the plethora of traceable data stored in Microsoft Excel.Jama Connect Interchange\u2122is purpose-built to deliver end-to-end Live Traceability\u2122 (see section below) across best-of-breed tools, including Microsoft Excel \u2014 and it\u2019s the first requirements management platform to make Excel data live traceable through a point and click, integration interface.\n\nNow teams can leverage the power of Jama Connect\u2019s traceability model to continuously sync traceable information from other best-of-breed tools with no change required for engineering disciplines to continue using their chosen tools to maximize productivity.\n\n> \u201cJama Connect is one of the vital and advanced tools of the modern era. It has a methodology that can ensure complete project tracking from the first step to the execution, test cases, rectification, quality assurance, project timelining, and much more in a streamlined way which has been increasing the overall ROI and efficiency of the project. The important factor of Jama Connect is that all board members can analyze and collaborate on the performance on the same stage, and this has been increasing trust between the clients and organizations while doing large-scale management.\u201d\n> Engineering Strategist\n> IT Services\n> Verified TrustRadius Review\n\n#### 8: Measuring and Improving Development Success with Live Traceability\u2122\n\nLive requirements traceability is the ability for any engineer at any time to see the most up to date and complete upstream and downstream information for any requirement \u2014 no matter the stage of systems development or how many siloed tools and teams it spans. This enables the engineering process to be managed through data, and its performance improved in real time.\n\n> \u201cRight off the initial stage of just importing the data in Jama Connect and trying to create the relationships, we actually saw that we had traceability gaps, just based on what we had done before in the old system. Catching these gaps would\u2019ve probably taken hours or days in our old system, while with Jama, it became obvious in a matter of minutes.\u201d\n> Julien Guillaume\n> Program Manager\n> \u00d6ssur\n\nBut you can\u2019t improve what you can\u2019t measure!\n\nJama Software\u00ae\u202fis the first to measure traceability thanks to our clients\u2019 participation in a benchmarking dataset of over 40,000 complex product development projects spanning aerospace, automotive, consumer electronics, industrial, medical device, semiconductor, space systems, and more.\n\n> \u201cWe have achieved:\u202fbetter requirement communication across departments; a better home for verification and validation test cases with traceability to the sources; and a detailed overview of traceability of requirements from regulatory requirements all the way down to risk items.\u201d\n> Stephen Cxerniej, P. Eng PMP\u00ae\n> Global Platform Systems Engineer\n> Allied Vision\n\nIf you\u2019d like to learn more, on how to measure your traceability to improve product quality and accelerate time to market \u2014 and get your Trace Score\u2122, check out our [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/requirements-traceability-benchmark?_gl=1*b9u8fc*_ga*NDkxNjE1NjIuMTY1NTk0MzUxMw..*_ga_JQG3M83PDQ*MTY1NzA3MTA0MC4zNy4xLjE2NTcwNzEwNDIuMA..)

Whether it\u2019s Microsoft Word, Excel, or a combination of both, trying to wrangle your product\u2019s requirements soley in documents carries a lot of risk and will gradually eat away at your company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThere was a time when using disparate documents wasn\u2019t such a problem for managing requirements, but as products grow in complexity, those days are fading. Many companies no longer produce products that contain just hardware or software; today it\u2019s likely a combination of both, increasing development complexity exponentially.\n\nIntegrating hardware and software means teams spanning various engineering disciplines all need to stay aligned throughout development, especially when things like safety standards and regulations are involved.\n\nUsing documents alone, will simply not be up to the task of meeting today\u2019s complex products, systems, and software development. When you need precision, context, and accountability for your requirements, a modern requirements management solution is really the only answer.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll detail some of the reasons why you\u2019ll want to leave disparate documents for managing requirements in your rearview. You\u2019ll also get an overview of the benefits you\u2019ll gain by moving to a purpose built software solution for requirements management.\n\n### Five Drawbacks of Documents\n\nMicrosoft Word and Excel serve many purposes, and have done so for decades. And, in terms of requirements, for early-phase documentation and coordinating simple projects, they still remain effective tools.\n\nAs the complexity of product and systems development grows, so does your list of requirements. And teams need solutions that provide simple and streamlined collaboration, not jumbled \u2014 often quickly outdated \u2014 comments and suggested edits.\n\nTeams need to be able to instantly connect to globally distributed colleagues to facilitate real-time feedback and make smarter decisions with full context around requirements. Documents simply aren\u2019t up to the\n\nchallenge.\n\n#### Here are some of the key limitations for a document-based approach for storing requirements:\n\n**1. Documents are tedious to maintain:** Anyone who has ever managed requirements with documents and several collaborators is familiar with the unique pains of this approach. Whether it\u2019s Word documents that are hundreds of pages long or Excel spreadsheets with thousands of lines, keeping them fresh with updates and free of errors is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n**2. Versioning difficulties:** Collaborating on any kind of important documentation can be painstaking, especially when there\u2019s an enormous amount of requirements involved. For instance, when reviewing requirements, it\u2019s incredibly easy for two people to be looking at different versions of the same set of requirements, and not even know it. And even if it\u2019s a cloud-based version of requirements, there are still plenty of opportunities for someone to unintentionally change something without getting prior approval, and that adjustment not being accounted for in future versions. Plus, online/cloud-based documents do not automatically create different IDs and versions for each requirement or highlight the changes between versions.\n\n**3. No traceability:** There\u2019s so much room for error through email chains and undisclosed updates. It\u2019s incredibly simple, for example, to miss a tiny change that could have critical ramifications upstream or\n\ndownstream.\n\n**4. Reviews are time-consuming:** Without traceability, review cycles with an enormous document of requirements are extremely long. You\u2019re likely looking at scheduling lengthy meetings or passing around version after version, pulling team members away from other priorities, which is not ideal when you\u2019re focused on getting to market quickly. And if you\u2019re trying to manage reviews asynchronously, collaboration becomes tricky and timelines are likely to get pushed as people\u2019s schedules shift.\n\n**5. Exhausting collaboration between teams:** Sharing constantly evolving requirements files among multiple stakeholders and different teams throughout the development and testing process is risky, frustrating, and time-consuming. And with your customer demanding a perfect product, system, or software delivered ASAP, you can no longer afford that kind of inefficiency.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution for Software Development](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/buyers-guide-selecting-a-collaborative-software-requirements-management-platform)\n\n### Seven Benefits of Using a Requirements Management Solution\n\nDespite rising product complexity and regulation, most development teams do not have a sophisticated requirement management system in place. In fact, according to a [recent survey](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/axendia-report-the-costly-impact-of-ineffective-requirements-management), almost one third of teams have no system in place and rely on formal processes with email, documents, and shared spreadsheets.\n\nAnother 52% manage their requirements with a system which is not meant for managing requirements, like Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) or Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. And only 15% have chosen to invest in a formal dedicated requirement management solution.\n\nUsing a dedicated requirements management solution allows teams to stop getting bogged down on processes and start innovating. For example, [MediSync](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/medisync-saves-time-with-jama-software/) reports that investing in Jama Connect\u00ae has saved 80% of the time that would have otherwise been spent on meetings, sorting through versions of Word documents and emails, and consolidating feedback in review cycles.\n\n[Grifols](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/healthcare-leader-grifols-uses-jama-connect-to-cut-costs-and-speed-development) saved around 80 hours per project in medical device development when using the Jama Connect Review Center. And [RBC Medical](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/streamlining-workflow-and-strengthening-collaboration-when-developing-medical-devices)\u00a0**(now known as Vantage Medtech)** saved around $150,000 per project by improving team collaboration and workflow efficiencies using Jama Connect.\n\n#### Here are some of the benefits you\u2019ll get from investing in a solid requirements management solution:\n\n**1. Version and change management:** A solid requirements management solution will maintain a history of each change made to every requirement. You\u2019ll also be able to record the rationale behind each change, and refer back to a previous version of a requirement if necessary. Some solutions contain a change proposal system that links change requests directly to requirements. And, with a formal requirements management solution, you\u2019ll always know you\u2019re looking at the most recent version of the requirements.\n\n**2. Requirements attributes:** With a strong requirements management solution, you should be able to record several descriptive attributes for each requirement. The right requirements management software should generate several system-defined attributes such as the date the requirement was created, its current version number, and the person on the requirements should be able to view these attributes, even if only a couple of individuals are allowed to update the attributes\u2019 values.\n\n**3. Facilitate impact analysis:** A requirements management solution enables requirements tracing by letting you define links between different types of requirements, requirements and different subsystems, and individual requirements and related system components (designs, modules, tests, and user documentation). These links help you analyze the impact that the proposed change will have on a specific requirement. It\u2019s also very helpful to have the ability to trace each functional requirement back to its origin or parent so that you know exactly where every requirement came from. And some solutions use a traceability link to raise suspect flags to a linked item whenever a change is made, so you know exactly what needs to be reviewed after a change.\n\n**4. Track requirements status:** Collecting requirements in a database lets you know how many discrete requirements you\u2019ve specified for the product. And tracking the status of each requirement during development helps communicate how things are coming along to those across the organization. So, a project manager has good insights into prior states if he or she knows that, for example, 55% of the requirements committed to the next release have been verified, 28% have been implemented but not verified, and 70% have not yet been fully implemented. This type of information gives the project manager information to anticipate the project\u2019s progress, and relay the message to stakeholders accordingly.\n\n**5. Control access:** A requirements management solution should let you bring as many people into the system as possible, and grant them permission to access the specific parts they\u2019re working on. This helps teams across the organization feel more invested in the product being developed and its progress.\n\n**6. Facilitating communication with stakeholders: **A requirements management solution should allow team members to discuss requirements issues electronically through a threaded conversation, in one central location, as opposed to having communication spread out across various platforms. It will automatically trigger email messages and notify effective individuals when a new discussion entry is made or when a specific requirement is modified. And it should allow team members to reach out to each other, but also contact non-project members and external users.\n\n**7. Recycling/reusing requirements:** Storing requirements in a central database facilitates the reuse of them in multiple projects or sub-projects. And requirements that logically fit into multiple parts of the same product can be stored once and referenced whenever necessary to avoid duplicates. This saves a lot of time and reduces the chance of making errors.\n\n### Why You Need Jama Connect\u00ae\n\nHopefully, you recognize why it makes sense to swap documents for a formal requirements management solution.

Whether it\u2019s Microsoft Word, Excel, or a combination of both, trying to wrangle your product\u2019s requirements soley in documents carries a lot of risk and will gradually eat away at your company\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThere was a time when using disparate documents wasn\u2019t such a problem for managing requirements, but as products grow in complexity, those days are fading. Many companies no longer produce products that contain just hardware or software; today it\u2019s likely a combination of both, increasing development complexity exponentially.\n\nIntegrating hardware and software means teams spanning various engineering disciplines all need to stay aligned throughout development, especially when things like safety standards and regulations are involved.\n\nUsing documents alone, will simply not be up to the task of meeting today\u2019s complex products, systems, and software development. When you need precision, context, and accountability for your requirements, a modern requirements management solution is really the only answer.\n\nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll detail some of the reasons why you\u2019ll want to leave disparate documents for managing requirements in your rearview. You\u2019ll also get an overview of the benefits you\u2019ll gain by moving to a purpose built software solution for requirements management.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Five Drawbacks of Documents", "level": 3, "content": "Microsoft Word and Excel serve many purposes, and have done so for decades. And, in terms of requirements, for early-phase documentation and coordinating simple projects, they still remain effective tools.\n\nAs the complexity of product and systems development grows, so does your list of requirements.

Documents simply aren\u2019t up to the\n\nchallenge.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Here are some of the key limitations for a document-based approach for storing requirements:", "level": 4, "content": "**1. Documents are tedious to maintain:** Anyone who has ever managed requirements with documents and several collaborators is familiar with the unique pains of this approach. Whether it\u2019s Word documents that are hundreds of pages long or Excel spreadsheets with thousands of lines, keeping them fresh with updates and free of errors is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming.\n\n**2. Versioning difficulties:** Collaborating on any kind of important documentation can be painstaking, especially when there\u2019s an enormous amount of requirements involved. For instance, when reviewing requirements, it\u2019s incredibly easy for two people to be looking at different versions of the same set of requirements, and not even know it. And even if it\u2019s a cloud-based version of requirements, there are still plenty of opportunities for someone to unintentionally change something without getting prior approval, and that adjustment not being accounted for in future versions. Plus, online/cloud-based documents do not automatically create different IDs and versions for each requirement or highlight the changes between versions.\n\n**3. No traceability:** There\u2019s so much room for error through email chains and undisclosed updates. It\u2019s incredibly simple, for example, to miss a tiny change that could have critical ramifications upstream or\n\ndownstream.\n\n**4. Reviews are time-consuming:** Without traceability, review cycles with an enormous document of requirements are extremely long. You\u2019re likely looking at scheduling lengthy meetings or passing around version after version, pulling team members away from other priorities, which is not ideal when you\u2019re focused on getting to market quickly. And if you\u2019re trying to manage reviews asynchronously, collaboration becomes tricky and timelines are likely to get pushed as people\u2019s schedules shift.\n\n**5. Exhausting collaboration between teams:** Sharing constantly evolving requirements files among multiple stakeholders and different teams throughout the development and testing process is risky, frustrating, and time-consuming. And with your customer demanding a perfect product, system, or software delivered ASAP, you can no longer afford that kind of inefficiency.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution for Software Development](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/buyers-guide-selecting-a-collaborative-software-requirements-management-platform)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Seven Benefits of Using a Requirements Management Solution", "level": 3, "content": "Despite rising product complexity and regulation, most development teams do not have a sophisticated requirement management system in place. In fact, according to a [recent survey](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/axendia-report-the-costly-impact-of-ineffective-requirements-management), almost one third of teams have no system in place and rely on formal processes with email, documents, and shared spreadsheets.\n\nAnother 52% manage their requirements with a system which is not meant for managing requirements, like Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) or Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. And only 15% have chosen to invest in a formal dedicated requirement management solution.\n\nUsing a dedicated requirements management solution allows teams to stop getting bogged down on processes and start innovating. For example, [MediSync](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/medisync-saves-time-with-jama-software/) reports that investing in Jama Connect\u00ae has saved 80% of the time that would have otherwise been spent on meetings, sorting through versions of Word documents and emails, and consolidating feedback in review cycles.\n\n[Grifols](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/healthcare-leader-grifols-uses-jama-connect-to-cut-costs-and-speed-development) saved around 80 hours per project in medical device development when using the Jama Connect Review Center. And [RBC Medical](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/streamlining-workflow-and-strengthening-collaboration-when-developing-medical-devices)\u00a0**(now known as Vantage Medtech)** saved around $150,000 per project by improving team collaboration and workflow efficiencies using Jama Connect.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Here are some of the benefits you\u2019ll get from investing in a solid requirements management solution:", "level": 4, "content": "**1. Version and change management:** A solid requirements management solution will maintain a history of each change made to every requirement. You\u2019ll also be able to record the rationale behind each change, and refer back to a previous version of a requirement if necessary. Some solutions contain a change proposal system that links change requests directly to requirements. And, with a formal requirements management solution, you\u2019ll always know you\u2019re looking at the most recent version of the requirements.\n\n**2. Requirements attributes:** With a strong requirements management solution, you should be able to record several descriptive attributes for each requirement. The right requirements management software should generate several system-defined attributes such as the date the requirement was created, its current version number, and the person on the requirements should be able to view these attributes, even if only a couple of individuals are allowed to update the attributes\u2019 values.\n\n**3. Facilitate impact analysis:** A requirements management solution enables requirements tracing by letting you define links between different types of requirements, requirements and different subsystems, and individual requirements and related system components (designs, modules, tests, and user documentation). These links help you analyze the impact that the proposed change will have on a specific requirement. It\u2019s also very helpful to have the ability to trace each functional requirement back to its origin or parent so that you know exactly where every requirement came from. And some solutions use a traceability link to raise suspect flags to a linked item whenever a change is made, so you know exactly what needs to be reviewed after a change.\n\n**4. Track requirements status:** Collecting requirements in a database lets you know how many discrete requirements you\u2019ve specified for the product. And tracking the status of each requirement during development helps communicate how things are coming along to those across the organization. So, a project manager has good insights into prior states if he or she knows that, for example, 55% of the requirements committed to the next release have been verified, 28% have been implemented but not verified, and 70% have not yet been fully implemented. This type of information gives the project manager information to anticipate the project\u2019s progress, and relay the message to stakeholders accordingly.\n\n**5. Control access:** A requirements management solution should let you bring as many people into the system as possible, and grant them permission to access the specific parts they\u2019re working on. This helps teams across the organization feel more invested in the product being developed and its progress.\n\n**6. Facilitating communication with stakeholders: **A requirements management solution should allow team members to discuss requirements issues electronically through a threaded conversation, in one central location, as opposed to having communication spread out across various platforms. It will automatically trigger email messages and notify effective individuals when a new discussion entry is made or when a specific requirement is modified. And it should allow team members to reach out to each other, but also contact non-project members and external users.\n\n**7. Recycling/reusing requirements:** Storing requirements in a central database facilitates the reuse of them in multiple projects or sub-projects. And requirements that logically fit into multiple parts of the same product can be stored once and referenced whenever necessary to avoid duplicates. This saves a lot of time and reduces the chance of making errors.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Why You Need Jama Connect\u00ae", "level": 3, "content": "Hopefully, you recognize why it makes sense to swap documents for a formal requirements management solution.

(ALM)\n\nAs\u00a0products evolve, so must the\u00a0application\u00a0development process. Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is born from what used to be a slew of different functions\u2014project management, requirements management, development, testing, quality assurance\u00a0(QA), delivery, and support\u2014working in siloed environments.\u00a0\u00a0The work of\u00a0these disciplines\u00a0depends on one another\u00a0and needs\u00a0to be\u00a0conducted with continued collaboration\u00a0to achieve maximum efficiency in the shortest timeframe.\n\n### What is ALM?\n\nApplication lifecycle management (ALM) integrates the people, processes, and tools involved with software application development from preliminary planning through end-of-life. This unification optimizes communication and collaboration among all groups responsible for application development. Benefits of Application Lifecycle Management include improved quality, increased efficiency, and seamless overall management and maintenance of products.\n\nTypically, ALM and PLM have been separate processes, each using their individual software solutions and tools. But with the near-omnipresent convergence of hardware and software in product development, the process is likely to evolve.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [What to Look for in Application Lifecycle Management Tools](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-to-look-for-in-application-lifecycle-management-tools/)\n\n### Why is ALM important for development teams?\n\nUnifying previously disparate practices into a single process\u00a0is an invaluable asset when it comes to creating complex software.\u00a0That\u2019s why\u00a0ALM is important\u2014it\u00a0helps companies realize a multitude of benefits such as,\u00a0enhancing\u00a0visibility throughout the software life cycle, simplifying\u00a0estimates to\u00a0assist with budget management, increasing\u00a0efficiency\u00a0to get applications to market quicker, and strengthening\u00a0product\u00a0quality.\n\n### Best practices, templates, and tools for application lifecycle management\n\nThe most important best practice for application lifecycle management\u00a0is to use the right tool for the job.\n\nIf you\u2019re a part of a growing team,\u00a0a\u00a0Requirements Traceability Matrix template\u00a0can help your ALM process.

Differing practices within the application development process usually means disparate best-of-breed tools to optimize activities.\n\nSome companies try to force organizations into one software platform in an attempt to achieve the benefits of end-to-end process visibility. Typically, this approach fails due to lack of adoption and the result is an overall decrease in productivity. Therefore, it is important that your ALM tool adapts to the development methodology your teams already use so they don\u2019t have to change their workflow.\n\nTracking requirements throughout the lifecycle is critical to the success of the software delivered and ensures it meets the specifications set out to build.\u00a0 Being able to link these requirements across the application lifecycle creates a\u00a0[digital thread](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-the-definition-of-a-digital-thread/). In Jama Connect\u00ae, this process is supported through Live Traceability\u2122.\n\nThis is essential for regulated industries and is a best practice for any complex application development.\u00a0It\u00a0reduces the risk of negative product outcomes while preserving engineering autonomy and productivity.\n\nThis flexibility\u00a0helps increase adoption and usage, thus allowing you to quickly realize the benefits of an ALM tool\u2014increased collaboration, productivity, visibility, etc.\n\n#### Estimation and Planning\n\nALM tools can help with project estimation and planning, however the development method they are designed for can vary.\u00a0It\u2019s important to choose a tool that can support both waterfall and agile development.\n\nFor complex and regulated\u00a0product development it\u2019s also important to have an ALM tool with workflow functionality so you can set up a track to be followed systematically.\n\n#### Collaboration and Communication\n\nSuccessful development of complex applications requires top-notch communication and collaboration throughout the development life cycle. Out-of-context communications like email won\u2019t cut it.\n\nYour ALM tool of choice must allow for information flow in real time so it\u2019s never out of\u00a0date,\u00a0and\u00a0be\u00a0on record tied to the requirement or artifact\u00a0it pertains to. This way\u00a0visibility is upheld, and all parties know the latest information.\n\n#### Source Code Management\n\nWhile the coding aspect of software development is not regarded as a part of application lifecycle management, it is part of overall development. Therefore, the source code management functionality must be integrated into the ALM tool to ensure\u00a0[requirements traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/what-is-requirements-traceability-and-why-does-it-matter-for-product-teams/)\u00a0from definition through testing and defect resolution.\n\nAs stated\u00a0previously, software engineers should be able to choose their preferred coding\u00a0software\u00a0and still have it\u00a0integrate with the ALM tool. Be sure to research\u00a0[ALM tool\u00a0integration capabilities](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/integrations/)\u00a0before selecting\u00a0a management solution\u00a0to ensure the tool is flexible.\n\n#### Testing and Quality Assurance\n\nQuality assurance\u00a0is a\u00a0leading\u00a0factor in an ALM tool.\u00a0What sets sophisticated ALM tools apart is the ability to truly deliver\u00a0end-to-end traceability. This means\u00a0it is\u00a0imperative to connect requirements with test status and ensure all requirements are verified and validated.\n\nBest practice is to involve quality and testing teams earlier in the process to validate requirements and review and approve test plans. To achieve this goal, an ALM tool must\u00a0make\u00a0test\u00a0case\u00a0management\u00a0a top priority.\n\n[Top features of test management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/test-management/)\u00a0are the ability to monitor test progress with smart dashboards, perform both manual user-acceptance testing and support automated testing, trace failed tests to new and existing defects, reuse validated requirements, and integrate with your existing QA and testing ecosystem.\n\n#### Deployment or DevOps\n\nLike source code management,\u00a0deployment\u00a0and DevOps are not\u00a0typically considered part of ALM, however, your ALM tool needs to integrate with\u00a0DevOps tools and\u00a0the continuous integration servers your teams are using\u00a0for deployment. Furthermore, the dashboards and reports within the tool must have the ability to incorporate the data so full visibility is\u00a0achievable.\n\n#### Version Control\n\nWhen using spreadsheets for ALM,\u00a0version control can be a nightmare. An ALM tool, on the other hand, houses a complete history of changes made to the application.\u00a0Smart ALM tools also feature personalized dashboards and reports.\u00a0This is\u00a0beneficial for decision making and invaluable for regulatory compliance.\n\n#### Ongoing Support and Maintenance\n\nThis feature of ALM tools is not to be overlooked, as keeping customers happy is the lifeblood of any business. Support is what separates good apps from\u00a0cherished ones.\u00a0Also, customer feedback is often the fuel for new ideas and features. Be sure to choose an\u00a0[ALM platform with\u00a0premier\u00a0support](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/g2-awards-jama_connect-leader-in-alm-software-spring-2021).\n\n#### Project and Portfolio Management\n\nFull visibility into the application development lifecycle is, of course, one of the main goals of an ALM tool. With so many moving parts it can be hard to know\u00a0where to look and when. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial that your management tool have custom reports and smart dashboards to easily view strategic project metrics.\n\nAdditionally, you may already use a Project Portfolio Management tool, in which case, an\u00a0[ALM tool that can easily integrate](https://www.jamasoftware.com/platform/jama-connect/integrations/)\u00a0will be an important feature to seek out.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Selecting the Right Requirements Management Tools and Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/requirements-management-tools-and-software/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tools-and-software)\n\n### Current and future trends of application lifecycle management\n\nOne\u00a0leading\u00a0trend of application lifecycle management is that software and hardware are continuously converging. Smart devices are both hardware and software\u2014they cannot be distinguished as only one or the other\u2014and must be developed simultaneously.\n\nALM is used by software teams to produce applications and software systems. These teams typically use agile development methodologies. In contrast, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is used in manufacturing industries to build hardware and physical systems. Historically, hardware teams have typically used a waterfall development methodology. The main difference between PLM and ALM lies is in what is being built.\n\nAgain, as products advance, it changes the way in which they are created. The best way to get ahead of this trend is to use a lifecycle management tool that is configurable and enables toolchain integration. That way, no matter what development methodology, testing tools, bug-tracking software, etc., you\u2019re using, the platform can adapt to the required workflow \u2013 regardless of what you\u2019re building.\n\nJama Connect\u00a0does exactly that.\u00a0It is\u00a0a web-based application\u00a0that supports complex products with both hardware and software components. Jama Connect is a forward-thinking solution in that it\u00a0supports any development model and can conform to the workflow that makes most sense for the teams using it.

Development teams choose it for its flexibility and focus on execution. But is Jira the right tool for managing complex product requirements and testing? While it excels at managing the work of building software, relying on it alone for defining, tracing, and verifying requirements can introduce significant risks to product quality and compliance. We\u2019ll explore the strengths and weaknesses of using Jira for requirements management and outline a best-practice approach of combining the strengths of Jira and a dedicated requirements platform like Jama Connect\u00ae.\n\n### What makes Jira a popular choice for software development teams?\n\nJira\u2019s popularity is well-earned based on it providing an intuitive framework for agile methodologies that allows software engineers to break down large projects into manageable user stories, tasks, and sprints. Its core strength lies in workflow management\u2014moving tickets across a board from \u201cTo Do\u201d to \u201cDone.\u201d For developers, it\u2019s a familiar environment that streamlines their day-to-day work, tracks progress on specific coding tasks, and facilitates collaboration within the software development team. This focus on execution makes it an indispensable tool for accelerating software development speed.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Leveraging Jama Connect and Jira for Enhanced Requirements](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/leveraging-jama-connect-and-jira-for-enhanced-requirements-management/)\n\n### Can Jira handle requirements management and traceability?\n\nDespite its strengths in task management, Jira was not designed to manage complex product requirements, especially for many of today\u2019s products or systems that combine software and hardware. Key limitations include:\n\n- **Limited traceability:** Creating and maintaining a complete traceability matrix in Jira is challenging. Linking high-level system requirements to software requirements, test cases, risk analyses, and downstream tasks is a manual, time-consuming, error-prone process. When changes are made, it is nearly impossible to ensure that all stakeholders can assess the impact of the change on their work.\n- **Weak versioning and baselining:** Jira lacks the sophisticated version control and baselining capabilities needed to manage changes effectively. It\u2019s difficult to capture a snapshot of all requirements at a specific point in time for a review or release, which is a critical need for audits and regulatory compliance.\n- **Poor impact analysis:** When a requirement changes, understanding the full impact across the entire system is crucial. Jira\u2019s flat structure makes it difficult to visualize these complex relationships, increasing the risk of missed updates and downstream defects.\n- **Limited support for reviews:** Jira lacks a structured way of initiating and completing reviews with all stakeholders. Tasks can only be assigned to one owner and even when assigned to a group, there are no structured workflows for sending invitations to reviewers that may include external stakeholders who are not Jira users, completing reviews, or dealing with approvals or rejections.\n- **Inaccessible by non-technical stakeholders:** While software developers feel at home in Jira, product managers, compliance officers, and other business stakeholders often find Jira\u2019s interface overwhelming and not conducive to the input, review and approval workflows required for formal requirements management.\n\n![Road signs displaying the many limitations of using only Jira for requirements management, including limited traceability, weak versioning, poor impact analysis, limited review support, and inaccessible interface.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/09/Jiras-Limitations-in-Requirements-Management-1030x573.png)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

The primary challenge is to balance the speed of agile development with the strict demands of quality and regulatory compliance. Live Traceability\u2122 is the key to achieving this balance. It provides a real-time, interconnected view of the entire development lifecycle, from initial customer need through to requirements, design, code, and testing. This end-to-end visibility is essential for proving adherence to standards, conducting thorough impact analysis, and verifying that the final product meets all specified requirements and regulations, thereby reducing the risk of costly late-stage rework to fix defects.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Limitations, Drawbacks, and Risks of Using Legacy Requirements Management Tools](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-limitations-drawbacks-and-risks-of-using-legacy-requirements-management-tools-3)\n\n### How does a dedicated requirements management tool fill these gaps?\n\nA purpose-built requirements management solution is designed to address the specific challenges that task managers like Jira are not equipped to handle. It provides a centralized, single source of truth for all requirements with powerful features for creating complex requirement hierarchies, establishing traceability across all development artifacts, and managing variants for different product lines. Furthermore, they include formal processes for collaboration, review, approval, and change management, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned and that every modification is properly documented and analyzed before implementation.\n\n### What is the best-practice approach for integrating Jira into a requirements management process?\n\nThe most effective strategy is not to replace Jira but to augment it. The best practice, adopted by leading companies worldwide, is to use a best-of-breed toolchain where each tool is used for its core strength. In this model, a dedicated platform like Jama Connect serves as the system of record for defining and managing requirements and tests. Jira remains the tool of choice for the software development team to manage their sprints, user stories, and defects. The two systems are then integrated through automated processes that make error-prone, manual coordination obsolete.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Why Migrate to Jama Connect?](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/better-than-ibm-doors/)\n\n### What is the best-practice approach for integrating Jira into a requirements management process?\n\nThe most effective strategy is not to replace Jira but to augment it.

Validation focuses on whether the software meets the expectations and requirements of the end user.\n\n**If you\u2019re developing a medical device, this distinction may also be included in regulations and standards, for example: \u00a0**\n\n- 820.30(f): Design verification shall confirm that the design output meets the design input requirements.\n- 820.30(g): Design validation shall ensure that devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard the terms \u201cverification\u201d and \u201cvalidation\u201d used interchangeably, you aren\u2019t alone. However, this creates confusion during the testing process, and if you\u2019re building products in highly regulated industries, it\u2019s critical that products perform as expected and expensive errors are avoided.\n\nUnclear and incomplete requirements can be frustrating for developers, and if developers can\u2019t get the required information upfront, they must make interpretations, which aren\u2019t always correct. The result is a higher risk of errors and extra resources spent fixing issues further into the product development cycle.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between verification and validation and how to use each during product development helps reduce cost, increase efficiency and deliver a product that better fits user requirements.\n\n### What is requirements verification?\n\n![This image shows a badge with a checkmark, portraying verification and validation](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Best-Practices-no-BG-Rev.png)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used verification and validation interchangeably in the past, one of the most important things to note is the order. Software verification comes first, followed by validation. But what\u2019s involved with each? Let\u2019s dive into verification first.\n\nVerification tests check to ensure the program is built according to the stated requirements. The verification process includes activities such as reviewing the code and doing walkthroughs and inspections.\n\nMissing requirements or invalid requirements can be discovered during this phase, which can minimize the risk of rework and the cost associated with overruns. It\u2019s far more effective to fix a small bug upfront than in the future when hundreds of lines of code must be identified and corrected.\n\nFor example, imagine that you\u2019re driving to a new destination. You might plug that destination into your GPS, which provides directions and the freeway exit number. If you\u2019re looking for exit 10 and just passed exit 1, you quickly know you have nine more exits to go. \u00a0This is similar to the verification phrase in that using the GPS allows you to check your existing path against the directions.\n\nAnother example is entering a formula into a spreadsheet. After entering a few rows of data, you might check the formula and make sure that it\u2019s working. The process of verification is the same in that it allows you to do a quick check before getting too deep into the product development process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Plutora \u2013 Verification vs Validation: Do You Know the Difference?](https://www.plutora.com/blog/verification-vs-validation)\n\n### What is requirements validation?\n\nThe answer to that question might vary depending on which industry you are in and which type of requirement is being validated.\n\nIn general, after you\u2019ve qualified what type of requirement is being validated and completed verification, it\u2019s time to complete validation testing, which confirms the accuracy of the requirements. It ensures that the requirements have achieved the business objectives, meet the needs of any relevant stakeholders and are clearly understood by developers. Validation is a critical step to finding missing requirements and ensuring that requirements have a variety of important characteristics. Software validation addresses the following:\n\n- Correctly outlines the end user\u2019s need.\n- Has only one exact meaning.\n- Can be modified as necessary.\n- Documents the attributes that customers truly need.\n- Easily linked to system requirements, such as designs, codes and tests.\n\nValidation isn\u2019t focused on the path that you traveled to arrive at the destination but is instead focused on whether you\u2019ve hit the mark. For example, consider the last example of a person traveling in a car and tracking landmarks, such as exit numbers. Let\u2019s say the goal is to arrive at a hiking trail. A few questions might be asked when you arrive.\n\n- Does the hiking trail look as expected?\n- Can I see a marked trail and trailhead sign?\n- Does the location meet my expectations?\n\nValidation is focused on the same types of questions. It\u2019s not concerned with *how* you got there, but that you arrived at the correct location.\n\nIf you\u2019re designing a spreadsheet, as we discussed before, you checked that the formula worked during the verification process. During validation, you\u2019re making sure the end product (the spreadsheet) meets the needs of the user.\n\nFor example, using the spreadsheet example, maybe we determined we are going to use a spreadsheet to reduce the time it takes us to \u201cx\u201d or reduce the errors we see when we \u201cy\u201d, so we implement a spreadsheet with a bunch of functions, the functions defined by our requirements. Verification asks, does the spreadsheet work per the requirements (\u201cdid we build it right\u201d); Validation asks, does the spreadsheet actually accomplish the goals related to x and y (\u201cdid we build the right thing\u201d)\n\nAnd even when a product is fully verified \u2013 it still may not meet the needs of the user, i.e., failed validation.\n\nTo Learn More About How the FDA Classifies the General Principles of Software Validation, Visit:\n\n[FDA Guidance: General Principles Software Validation](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-principles-software-validation)\n\n### Verification and validation: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nAs you consider validation vs. verification, you might feel unsure about the differences. What activities fall under the category of validation and which fall under verification, and when should you perform each?\n\nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re working to create a product and it\u2019s time for verification testing since verification always comes first. During this process, you check documents, design, code, and the program to make sure the software is built according to requirements. The goal is to ensure the quality of the application or design. You might conduct activities such as reviews, walkthroughs or inspections. For example, in the Medical Device Industry, verification usually happens with the \u201cdesign equivalent\u201d configuration of the product. Validation usually happens with the \u201cproduction equivalent\u201d of the product per 820.30(g).\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to move on to validation. During this process, you\u2019re testing and validating whether the product meets the needs of your customer. Tasks in this process may include unit testing, integration testing or user testing. As we stated at the top of this article, the verification process ensures that software meets specifications. Validation focuses on whether the software meets the expectations and requirements of the end-user.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Key Design Control Practices that Improve Compliance and Help Develop Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-key-design-control-practices-that-improve-compliance-and-help-develop-better-products/)\n\n#### Streamlining Collaboration During Verification and Validation with Requirements Management Software\n\nFor system engineers, being able to trace relationships between data types is essential. However, there can be a problem with multiple levels of requirements, specification, and verification artifacts all having their own set of stakeholders who are performing a variety of tasks.\n\nThe right software solution can simplify complicated situations and enable you to add traceability of the data. You can analyze the \u201cwho, what, where, and why\u201d of potential changes and make sure that essential data doesn\u2019t get overlooked. Look for a software solution that does the following:\n\n- Connects test cases from a problem statement to your requirements and design. If you don\u2019t have the ability to do this, you can\u2019t be sure that you haven\u2019t overlooked something critical.\n- Connects system requirements to business and stakeholder requirements. If you miss a critical connection, you risk unplanned expenses that may have a ripple effect and create slowdowns in product launches, weaken stakeholder confidence and adversely affect the bottom line.\n- Improves decomposition. It\u2019s critical to relate lower-level requirements to higher-level requirements to ensure that components and subcomponents all come together into a functional system. Mistakes in this area may lead to extra costs as you work hard to put the pieces back together and implement changes later in the product development process.\n\nA software solution is a critical tool in helping you manage the verification and validation process and ensure that every engineering activity is connected throughout the entire system life cycle. It\u2019s critical to capture all communication in context and bring stakeholders together in one place for a real-time and comprehensive look into what teams are building and why.\n\n#### Moving Into the Future\n\nTesting can be one of the most expensive parts of product development, if not properly planned. It\u2019s important to incorporate verification and validation to ensure cost savings and a high-quality product. In the end, if the product doesn\u2019t meet the original objectives, then time, money, and effort will have been wasted.\n\nFortunately, companies can get products to market faster when people and data stay in sync with product development activities and deliverables.

However, this creates confusion during the testing process, and if you\u2019re building products in highly regulated industries, it\u2019s critical that products perform as expected and expensive errors are avoided.\n\nUnclear and incomplete requirements can be frustrating for developers, and if developers can\u2019t get the required information upfront, they must make interpretations, which aren\u2019t always correct. The result is a higher risk of errors and extra resources spent fixing issues further into the product development cycle.\n\nUnderstanding the difference between verification and validation and how to use each during product development helps reduce cost, increase efficiency and deliver a product that better fits user requirements.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is requirements verification?", "level": 3, "content": "![This image shows a badge with a checkmark, portraying verification and validation](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/Best-Practices-no-BG-Rev.png)\n\nIf you\u2019ve used verification and validation interchangeably in the past, one of the most important things to note is the order. Software verification comes first, followed by validation. But what\u2019s involved with each? Let\u2019s dive into verification first.\n\nVerification tests check to ensure the program is built according to the stated requirements. The verification process includes activities such as reviewing the code and doing walkthroughs and inspections.\n\nMissing requirements or invalid requirements can be discovered during this phase, which can minimize the risk of rework and the cost associated with overruns. It\u2019s far more effective to fix a small bug upfront than in the future when hundreds of lines of code must be identified and corrected.\n\nFor example, imagine that you\u2019re driving to a new destination. You might plug that destination into your GPS, which provides directions and the freeway exit number. If you\u2019re looking for exit 10 and just passed exit 1, you quickly know you have nine more exits to go. \u00a0This is similar to the verification phrase in that using the GPS allows you to check your existing path against the directions.\n\nAnother example is entering a formula into a spreadsheet. After entering a few rows of data, you might check the formula and make sure that it\u2019s working. The process of verification is the same in that it allows you to do a quick check before getting too deep into the product development process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Plutora \u2013 Verification vs Validation: Do You Know the Difference?](https://www.plutora.com/blog/verification-vs-validation)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is requirements validation?", "level": 3, "content": "The answer to that question might vary depending on which industry you are in and which type of requirement is being validated.\n\nIn general, after you\u2019ve qualified what type of requirement is being validated and completed verification, it\u2019s time to complete validation testing, which confirms the accuracy of the requirements. It ensures that the requirements have achieved the business objectives, meet the needs of any relevant stakeholders and are clearly understood by developers. Validation is a critical step to finding missing requirements and ensuring that requirements have a variety of important characteristics. Software validation addresses the following:\n\nValidation isn\u2019t focused on the path that you traveled to arrive at the destination but is instead focused on whether you\u2019ve hit the mark. For example, consider the last example of a person traveling in a car and tracking landmarks, such as exit numbers. Let\u2019s say the goal is to arrive at a hiking trail. A few questions might be asked when you arrive.\n\nValidation is focused on the same types of questions. It\u2019s not concerned with *how* you got there, but that you arrived at the correct location.\n\nIf you\u2019re designing a spreadsheet, as we discussed before, you checked that the formula worked during the verification process. During validation, you\u2019re making sure the end product (the spreadsheet) meets the needs of the user.\n\nFor example, using the spreadsheet example, maybe we determined we are going to use a spreadsheet to reduce the time it takes us to \u201cx\u201d or reduce the errors we see when we \u201cy\u201d, so we implement a spreadsheet with a bunch of functions, the functions defined by our requirements. Verification asks, does the spreadsheet work per the requirements (\u201cdid we build it right\u201d); Validation asks, does the spreadsheet actually accomplish the goals related to x and y (\u201cdid we build the right thing\u201d)\n\nAnd even when a product is fully verified \u2013 it still may not meet the needs of the user, i.e., failed validation.\n\nTo Learn More About How the FDA Classifies the General Principles of Software Validation, Visit:\n\n[FDA Guidance: General Principles Software Validation](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/general-principles-software-validation)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Verification and validation: What\u2019s the difference?", "level": 3, "content": "As you consider validation vs. verification, you might feel unsure about the differences. What activities fall under the category of validation and which fall under verification, and when should you perform each?\n\nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re working to create a product and it\u2019s time for verification testing since verification always comes first. During this process, you check documents, design, code, and the program to make sure the software is built according to requirements. The goal is to ensure the quality of the application or design. You might conduct activities such as reviews, walkthroughs or inspections. For example, in the Medical Device Industry, verification usually happens with the \u201cdesign equivalent\u201d configuration of the product. Validation usually happens with the \u201cproduction equivalent\u201d of the product per 820.30(g).\n\nNow, it\u2019s time to move on to validation. During this process, you\u2019re testing and validating whether the product meets the needs of your customer. Tasks in this process may include unit testing, integration testing or user testing. As we stated at the top of this article, the verification process ensures that software meets specifications. Validation focuses on whether the software meets the expectations and requirements of the end-user.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Key Design Control Practices that Improve Compliance and Help Develop Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-key-design-control-practices-that-improve-compliance-and-help-develop-better-products/)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Streamlining Collaboration During Verification and Validation with Requirements Management Software", "level": 4, "content": "For system engineers, being able to trace relationships between data types is essential.

Verification and validation (V&V) are two crucial processes that play a pivotal role in achieving these goals. V&V are systematic methods that assess a product\u2019s adherence to specifications and its ability to perform as intended. In this article, we will delve into the best practices for verification and validation in product development, exploring the key steps, methodologies, and benefits of each process.\n\n![Best Practices for Verification and Validation](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/11/best-practices-leader-icon-b-light.svg)\n\n### Understanding Verification&Validation:\n\nBefore delving into the best practices, it is essential to clarify the distinction between verification and validation. Verification focuses on assessing whether a product meets its design specifications, ensuring that each component and feature works as intended. On the other hand, validation is concerned with evaluating whether the product fulfills its intended use and customer needs. In essence, verification confirms if the product is designed correctly, while validation confirms if it is the right product for the intended application.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Key Design Control Practices that Improve Compliance and Help Develop Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-key-design-control-practices-that-improve-compliance-and-help-develop-better-products/)\n\n![V Model image showing Verification and Validation in the Product Development Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/08/Jama-Connect-V-Model-1.png)\n\n### Incorporating V&V Early in the Development Lifecycle:\n\nTo maximize the effectiveness of verification and validation, these processes must be integrated into the product development lifecycle from its early stages. By starting V&V activities early, potential issues can be identified and resolved before they escalate, reducing costs and time-to-market. Early involvement also allows for feedback to be incorporated into the design, leading to a more robust and reliable final product.\n\n### Clearly Defined Requirements:\n\nWell-defined requirements are the foundation of successful verification and validation. During the requirements gathering phase, it is vital to engage stakeholders and subject matter experts to create clear, measurable, and unambiguous specifications. These requirements serve as the baseline against which the product will be verified and validated. Proper documentation and version control are critical to ensure that changes to requirements are tracked effectively. Additionally, the later in the development process that requirements get changed, many times because they weren\u2019t written well the first time, the more costly it is due to downstream impacts such as rework in verification and validation.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Plutora \u2013 Verification vs Validation: Do You Know the Difference?](https://www.plutora.com/blog/verification-vs-validation)\n\n### Utilizing Various V&V Techniques:\n\nProduct development teams should employ a mix of V&V techniques to comprehensively assess the product\u2019s quality. Some commonly used methods include:\n\n- **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing, to verify that each component and the product as a whole performs as expected.\n- **Simulation:** Use computer simulations to evaluate the product\u2019s behavior in various scenarios, particularly for complex systems or when physical testing is impractical or cost prohibitive.\n- **Prototyping:** Building prototypes early in the development process allows for real-world testing, uncovering potential design flaws and usability issues.\n- **Peer Reviews:** Encourage regular peer reviews of design documents, code, and other artifacts to catch errors and improve the overall quality of the product.\n- **Model-based Design:** Utilize model-based design approaches, such as Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), to create detailed models that can be verified before implementation.\n\n### Risk-Based Approach:\n\nIncorporate a risk-based approach into V&V activities to focus resources on critical areas. Identify potential risks associated with product failure and prioritize verification and validation efforts accordingly. This approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, concentrating on areas with the most significant impact on product performance and safety.\n\n### Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V):\n\nConsider engaging external experts or teams for independent verification and validation. External parties can provide an unbiased assessment of the product, uncovering issues that internal teams might overlook due to familiarity or assumptions. Independent verification and validation bring additional expertise and ensure a higher level of confidence in the product\u2019s quality.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Achieve Higher Levels of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/how-to-achieve-higher-levels-of-the-capability-maturity-model-integration-cmmi)\n\n### Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD):\n\nImplementing CI/CD practices allows for continuous verification and validation throughout the development process. Automated testing and deployment pipelines can quickly detect regressions and integration issues, ensuring that the product remains stable and reliable throughout its evolution.\n\n### Documenting V&V Activities:\n\nComprehensive documentation of all verification and validation activities is essential for compliance, knowledge retention, and continuous improvement. Properly documented V&V processes help maintain a historical record of changes, failures, and resolutions, facilitating future product iterations and troubleshooting.\n\nV & V are integral to successful product development, ensuring that products meet the required specifications and perform as intended. By adopting best practices such as early integration, clear requirements, a mix of v&v techniques, risk-based approaches, and continuous verification, companies can create high-quality, reliable products that customers love and gain a competitive edge in the market. Moreover, investing in verification and validation from the outset of development can save time and resources, prevent costly delays, and lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty in the long run.\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss How to Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122\n\nDEFINITION OF VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION:\n\n**Verification and Validation (V&V) ** are independent procedures that are used together for checking that a product, service, or system meets requirements and specifications and that it fulfills its intended purpose.

In this article, we will provide you with a basic guide to understanding ISO standards.\n\n### What is ISO and What are ISO Standards?\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization is a nongovernmental organization. It consists of a network of standards bodies from 165 member countries (currently), with one body representing each member country. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), for example, represents the United States. The organization maintains a central office in Geneva, Switzerland, to oversee this network.\n\nBecause \u201cInternational Organization for Standardization\u201d is a mouthful and would have different acronyms in different languages, the organization\u2019s founders chose ISO\u2014derived from the Greek \u2018isos\u2019, meaning equal\u2014as its official abbreviation. As the group\u2019s website proclaims: \u201cWhatever the country, whatever the language, we are always ISO.\u201d\n\nISO\u2019s purpose is to help unify standards on an international basis. ISO standards are designated by the term ISO followed by a number, like ISO 9001. In some cases, ISO standards share a numeric code with an industry association, as in the case of ISO/IEC 12207. IEC stands for the International Electrotechnical Commission, which prepares and publishes international standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies.\n\nNearly 800 ISO technical committees and subcommittees\u00a0are tasked with standards development. As of June 2021, ISO has published some 23,886 international standards covering almost all aspects of technology and manufacturing.\n\n### What Are the Benefits of ISO Standards?\n\nISO forms a bridge that links the public and private sectors. Many of its member institutes are either departments of their national governments or mandated by them. Other member organizations are rooted solely in the private sector, having been set up by industry association partnerships within their country. ISO helps these diverse bodies reach consensus on solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society.\n\nISO standards help make the world a safer place and give consumers confidence that the products they buy are safe, reliable, and of high quality. Regulators and governments count on ISO standards to help develop better regulation, knowing they have a sound basis thanks to the involvement of globally recognized experts.\n\nFinally, compliance with ISO standards gives companies an advantage in the marketplace. ISO certification provides assurance to potential customers that the company adheres to industry best practices. In many industries, companies require that their suppliers are certified to certain relevant ISO standards.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [A Guide to Understanding ISO Standards](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/a-guide-to-understanding-iso-standards/)\n\n### How Does ISO Design New Standards?\n\nThe ISO process for creating a new standard begins when an alliance of industry associations or consumer groups submits a request. ISO then recruits subject matter experts and industry stakeholders to form a technical committee or subcommittee. This committee executes a two-round drafting process and then takes a formal vote on the second draft. This second draft is called the Final Draft International Standard (FDIS). If the FDIS is approved, it is certified by the central secretariat, and ISO publishes it as an official international standard.\n\nAs technologies and best practices evolve, industry associations may request an update of an ISO standard. Different versions of the standard are distinguished by the year the revision was published appended to the standard designation. For example, the latest version of ISO 9001 is ISO 9001:2015.\n\n### What ISO Standards Are Related to Product Development?\n\n#### ISO 9001\n\nThe\u00a0[ISO 9000](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html)\u00a0family of quality management standards is easily the most popular set of industry standards in the world. Of these, ISO 9001 is the only one to which companies can be certified.\n\nISO 9001 describes how to put a Quality Management System (QMS) in place to better prepare your organization to produce quality products and services. Today, over one million companies in more than 170 countries are certified to ISO 9001:2015.\n\n#### ISO/IEC 12207\n\n[ISO/IEC 12207](https://www.iso.org/standard/43447.html),\u00a0*Systems and software engineering \u2013 Software lifecycle processes\u00a0*aims to define all the processes required for developing and maintaining software systems, including the outcomes and/or activities of each process.\n\nFirst introduced in 1995, ISO/IEC 12207 establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes with well-defined terminology that can be referenced by the software industry.

Standards typically allow some leeway for tailoring to individual organizational practices and obligations.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, many corporate and governmental customers want their suppliers to adhere to certain ISO standards, especially in industries that are multi-tiered or highly regulated. Certification to applicable standards is often a contractual requirement within those industries.\n\n### Is ISO Compliance Required by Law?\n\nThe ISO standards themselves are not legally binding. There are no laws that compel companies to meet or be certified to any ISO standards.\n\nHowever, national regulators may refer to ISO standards as examples of good practice. For example, a building regulation might say you must comply with certain local regulations and that one way of complying with those is to comply with a given ISO standard.\n\nAlso, while not legally bound, many companies find certification to certain ISO standards is a necessity if they wish to compete for contracts within their industry or with specific customers.\n\n### What is ISO Certification?\n\nIn this guide, we\u2019ve talked frequently about ISO compliance and ISO certification. So, what\u2019s the difference?\n\nCompliance simply means that your product or process conforms to the requirements of the ISO standard. ISO certification, on the other hand, is the result of a formal procedure and thus a bit more complicated.\n\nISO itself does certify companies directly. Instead, specific certification bodies perform the task of auditing and then certifying an organization\u2019s compliance with a given ISO standard. These bodies, often known as\u00a0*registrars*, must themselves be certified under a separate standard, ISO/IEC TS 17021.\n\nDuring the certification process, the registrar audits the organization to ensure that its operations are in compliance with processes outlined in the current ISO standard. Where inconsistencies or \u201cnon-conformities\u201d are found, the organization must typically create a program for correcting these problems before the registrar will issue a certificate.\n\nOnce an organization is granted certification, it receives a certification mark that can be used on its company stationery, websites, etc.\n\nWhen it comes to ISO standards governing ongoing business practices, like ISO 9001 for example, approval is typically valid for a period of three years. After that, the company must recertify to the current form of the standard.\n\n### Applying ISO Standards in Lifecycle and Requirements Management\n\nWhat tools can help meet ISO standards in the realm of product lifecycle management? Jama Software provides several.\n\nFirst and foremost of these is our flagship product, Jama Connect. For example, let\u2019s say your organization is seeking certification to ISO 9001.

It consists of a network of standards bodies from 165 member countries (currently), with one body representing each member country. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI), for example, represents the United States. The organization maintains a central office in Geneva, Switzerland, to oversee this network.\n\nBecause \u201cInternational Organization for Standardization\u201d is a mouthful and would have different acronyms in different languages, the organization\u2019s founders chose ISO\u2014derived from the Greek \u2018isos\u2019, meaning equal\u2014as its official abbreviation. As the group\u2019s website proclaims: \u201cWhatever the country, whatever the language, we are always ISO.\u201d\n\nISO\u2019s purpose is to help unify standards on an international basis. ISO standards are designated by the term ISO followed by a number, like ISO 9001. In some cases, ISO standards share a numeric code with an industry association, as in the case of ISO/IEC 12207. IEC stands for the International Electrotechnical Commission, which prepares and publishes international standards for electrical, electronic, and related technologies.\n\nNearly 800 ISO technical committees and subcommittees\u00a0are tasked with standards development.

Other member organizations are rooted solely in the private sector, having been set up by industry association partnerships within their country. ISO helps these diverse bodies reach consensus on solutions that meet both the requirements of business and the broader needs of society.\n\nISO standards help make the world a safer place and give consumers confidence that the products they buy are safe, reliable, and of high quality. Regulators and governments count on ISO standards to help develop better regulation, knowing they have a sound basis thanks to the involvement of globally recognized experts.\n\nFinally, compliance with ISO standards gives companies an advantage in the marketplace. ISO certification provides assurance to potential customers that the company adheres to industry best practices.

This committee executes a two-round drafting process and then takes a formal vote on the second draft. This second draft is called the Final Draft International Standard (FDIS). If the FDIS is approved, it is certified by the central secretariat, and ISO publishes it as an official international standard.\n\nAs technologies and best practices evolve, industry associations may request an update of an ISO standard.

Organizations face numerous threats to their information assets, ranging from cyberattacks to data breaches. To address these challenges, many businesses turn to internationally recognized standards for information security management, with ISO/IEC 27001 standing out as a cornerstone in this field.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [A Guide to Understanding ISO Standards](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/a-guide-to-understanding-iso-standards/)\n\n### Overview of ISO/IEC 27001:\n\nISO/IEC 27001 is a globally recognized standard that provides a systematic approach to managing sensitive information, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data within an organization. Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), this standard outlines best practices for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS).\n\n- Key Principles:\n\nRisk Management: ISO/IEC 27001 is fundamentally built on the concept of risk management. Organizations are required to identify and assess information security risks, implement controls to mitigate those risks, and continuously monitor and review the effectiveness of these controls.\nPDCA Cycle: The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is at the core of ISO/IEC 27001. Organizations plan their ISMS, implement the plan, check its effectiveness through monitoring and measurement, and act to continually improve the system.\n- Scope and Requirements:\n\nScope Definition: Organizations must clearly define the scope of their ISMS, specifying the boundaries and applicability of the standard within their operations.\nRisk Assessment: A comprehensive risk assessment is a critical component. This involves identifying assets, evaluating vulnerabilities and threats, and determining the potential impact of information security incidents.\nControl Objectives and Controls: ISO/IEC 27001 provides an Annex A, which includes a set of control objectives and controls covering various aspects of information security, such as access control, cryptography, and incident management. Organizations choose and implement controls based on their specific risk profile.\n- Implementation Process:\n\nLeadership and Commitment: Senior management plays a crucial role in the successful implementation of ISO/IEC 27001. Leadership commitment ensures that information security is integrated into the organization\u2019s culture and business processes.\nDocumentation: Proper documentation is essential to demonstrate compliance with the standard. This includes the Information Security Policy, risk assessment reports, and records of monitoring and measurement activities.\nTraining and Awareness: Employees need to be aware of their role in maintaining information security. Organizations should provide training programs to enhance the awareness and competence of personnel.\n- Certification Process:\n\nThird-Party Certification: Organizations can undergo a certification process conducted by accredited certification bodies to validate their compliance with ISO/IEC 27001. This certification provides assurance to stakeholders, customers, and partners that the organization has implemented a robust ISMS.\n- Benefits of ISO/IEC 27001:\n\nRisk Reduction: By identifying and addressing potential risks, organizations can significantly reduce the likelihood of security incidents.\nEnhanced Reputation: ISO/IEC 27001 certification enhances an organization\u2019s reputation, demonstrating a commitment to information security best practices.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance: Adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 helps organizations comply with various legal and regulatory requirements related to information security.\nCompetitive Advantage: Certification can be a differentiator in the marketplace, giving organizations a competitive edge by assuring customers of their commitment to information security.\n- Continual Improvement:\n\nMonitoring and Review: Regular monitoring and review of the ISMS ensure its ongoing effectiveness. This includes conducting internal audits and management reviews to identify areas for improvement.\nFeedback Loop: ISO/IEC 27001 emphasizes the importance of feedback mechanisms, ensuring that lessons learned from incidents or changes in the business environment are incorporated into the ISMS.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices Guide to Requirements & Requirements Management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/guide-to-requirements-and-requirements-management)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nISO/IEC 27001 provides a robust framework for organizations to establish and maintain an effective Information Security Management System. By adopting this standard, businesses can mitigate risks, enhance their reputation, and demonstrate a commitment to safeguarding sensitive information in an ever-evolving digital landscape. As information security continues to be a top priority, ISO/IEC 27001 remains a valuable tool for organizations seeking a comprehensive and internationally recognized approach to managing information security.\n\n*Note: This article was drafted with the aid of AI.

But what is DevSecOps really, and why is it so crucial?\n\nDevOps is a set of techniques that stresses collaboration and automation between development and operations teams. DevSecOps is the integration of security practices into this methodology. DevSecOps seeks to establish a security culture that guarantees the software is secure and complies with compliance standards by integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle, from planning through deployment.\n\n![DevSecOps](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/04/DEVSECOPS-Chart.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Practical Guide for Implementing Software Validation in Medical Devices: From FDA Guidance to Real-World Application \u2013 Part I](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/practical-guide-for-implementing-software-validation-in-medical-devices-from-fda-guidance-to-real-world-application-part-i?_gl=1*jgf4e*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NzY1Nzk2NjQuQ2owS0NRaUF4YmVmQmhEZkFSSXNBTDRYTFJxOFQ4X29zZHpQc2RSLWtwQVlHaWtWUGU4alJXS0lsWGJPMVBSMEpnOVlXSlg4YlZOOWRVQWFBZ2h3RUFMd193Y0I.*_ga*MjExNTU4NTA3OS4xNjczNDYxMTky*_ga_JQG3M83PDQ*MTY4MTc3NzYwNi4yNzEuMS4xNjgxNzc3OTAwLjYwLjAuMA..)\n\n### What are the advantages of DevSecOps?\n\nThe ability to identify and address security risks earlier in the development process is one of the main advantages of DevSecOps. This means that security is incorporated into the software at the outset instead of being added later, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Also, DevSecOps plays a big role in decreased risk of security breaches and data leaks by identifying vulnerabilities earlier.\n\nThe fact that DevSecOps helps to ensure compliance with laws and standards is another crucial feature of the practice. In many businesses, especially those that deal with sensitive or private data, including healthcare and banking, compliance is becoming more and more crucial. DevSecOps aids in ensuring that the software complies with requirements by incorporating compliance into the development process.\n\n### How does DevSecOps work?\n\nWhat does DevSecOps look like in practice? DevSecOps is fundamentally about cooperation and communication between teams working on development, security, and operations. This implies that everyone bears some kind of responsibility for security, not just the security team. Instead of adding security features later, development teams collaborate with security and operations teams to incorporate security into the software from the start.\n\nThe automation of DevSecOps is a crucial element. Automation makes the development process more efficient, reduces errors, and ensures consistency. DevSecOps can aid in the quicker and more precise detection of vulnerabilities and threats by automating security testing and other security operations.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Why it Makes Sense to Store Cybersecurity Risk Management Items Inside a Requirements Management System](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/why-it-makes-sense-to-store-cybersecurity-risk-management-items-inside-a-requirements-management-system)\n\n### Ongoing monitoring with DevSecOps\n\nContinuous monitoring is a key component of DevSecOps. This means that maintaining security involves ongoing monitoring and improvement rather than being a one-time action. DevSecOps can assist in identifying and mitigating risks before they turn into significant concerns by continuously monitoring the program for security threats and vulnerabilities.\n\nDevSecOps also depends on a culture that values security. As a result, security is more than just a collection of guidelines; it\u2019s also a way of thinking and conducting business. Organizations may ensure that security is always a top priority and that everyone is aware of the significance of security in their work by developing a culture of security.\n\nDevSecOps is a vital method of software development that places an emphasis on teamwork, automation, and constant monitoring. DevSecOps contributes to the creation of a security culture that guarantees the software is secure and complies with regulatory standards by integrating security into every phase of the software development lifecycle. Organizations that implement DevSecOps are well-positioned to produce secure and dependable software that satisfies the needs of their stakeholders and customers given the growing relevance of security in today\u2019s society.\n\nThere are numerous online resources, like blogs, podcasts, and online courses, that you may use to learn more about DevSecOps.

Within an organization\u2019s governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) framework, product teams must pursue market innovation while remaining in compliance with applicable regulations, standards and contractual requirements. Staying in compliance with the vast array of rules, procedures, and contract clauses that govern product development can be a full-time job, and lack of management can lead to delays and failures that result in lost revenue, damaged reputation, or even legal action.\n\nWith so much on the line, every development project should have a process within the GRC framework to monitor compliance risk and compliance activities along the way. Unfortunately, compliance management can be difficult to integrate into the full design process, and compliance delays can hold up a product launch. Product teams often need a better way to integrate compliance management into the development process. Those teams that include compliance management in their processes can reduce the risk of failure\u2014and potentially improve their speed to market.\n\n### What is compliance management, and how does it help product teams ship on time?\n\n**Compliance**\u00a0can refer to a variety of different laws, guidelines, standards, processes, procedures, or other controlling documents, including contracts.\u00a0**Compliance management**\u00a0refers to the intentional process by which designated team members or compliance officers monitor and control design, development, launch, and fulfillment to ensure that all legal, contractual, and procedural requirements are met.\n\nIdeally, compliance management involves both people and a system that is fully integrated across functions of the organization. The more integrated the compliance management in the development lifecycle, the more likely it is to detect potential compliance issues before they cause long-term harm to companies or consumers.\n\nA fully integrated compliance management system can help your product team ship on time or early by keeping all compliance factors top of mind during the design, development, and fulfillment process. When teams are ensuring compliance throughout the entire development lifecycle, unforeseen delays and consumer issues are less likely to derail product success.\n\nTo fully integrate compliance management, teams need a development process that includes touchpoints for assessing compliance. The process should include activities such as:\n\n- Standard operating procedures\n- Safety and security procedures\n- Reporting and documentation\n- Internal and external audits\n\nIntegrating all of these activities will help ensure that teams are fully prepared to establish compliance with applicable standards, regulations, and laws\u00a0*before*\u00a0launch, reducing the possibility of costly delays or failures.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Five Key Design Control Practices that Improve Compliance and Help Develop Better Products](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/five-key-design-control-practices-that-improve-compliance-and-help-develop-better-products/)\n\n### What is compliance control?\n\n**Compliance control** is a set of guidelines and policies designed to provide a framework for compliance to product teams and stakeholders. These guidelines and policies apply to everyone involved in compliance management\u2014from the board of directors to compliance officers or compliance managers to team members.\n\nCommon internal compliance controls can include the following:\n\n- Published standards, policies, and operating procedures\n- Training and documented completion of training\n- Internal audits\n- Contracts\n\nExternal compliance controls are those that originate anywhere outside the company:\n\n- Laws and regulations\n- Industry standards\n- External audits\n- External risk assessments\n\n### What is a compliance management system?\n\nA\u00a0**compliance management system**\u00a0is a program that integrates written documents, processes, functions, controls, tools, and anything else that helps organizations comply with regulations and reduce risks to consumers that arise due to violation of applicable law. While a comprehensive compliance management system will include appropriate tools such as software, it will also clearly define the roles of various stakeholders, including:\n\n- Team members\n- Compliance officers or compliance managers\n- Board of directors\n- Internal auditors\n\nThe compliance management system will also define processes for:\n\n- Assessing and responding to consumer complaints\n- Addressing results of a compliance audit\n- Providing relevant compliance training as appropriate\n- Keeping informed of regulatory change\n- Taking corrective action when products are found in violation\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [ BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHTS Three Ways to Proactively (vs Reactively) Incorporate Design Controls in Medical Device Product Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/three-ways-to-proactively-vs-reactively-incorporate-design-controls-in-medical-device-product-development/)\n\n### Why is maintaining compliance so important for product teams working in regulated industries?\n\nFormer US Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty has stated, \u201cIf you think compliance is expensive, try non-compliance.\u201d In any industry, non-compliance can lead to fines, product failures, recalls and lawsuits\u2014not to mention the cost of lost reputation, customers, and business.\n\nFor teams working in regulated industries, maintaining compliance is especially important as there are often unique safety and regulatory issues at hand. In industries such as automotive, aerospace, and medical devices, a product that fails to meet regulatory or legal standards could potentially lead to the kind of product failure that results in loss of property or human life.\n\nStudies by the Ponemon Institute reveal that[\u00a0non-compliance can cost as much as 2.65 times what compliance costs](https://inspectorio.com/blog/2021/02/15/4-hidden-costs-of-non-compliance/). What\u2019s more, the institute found that non-compliance costs increased by 45% between 2011 and 2017.\n\n### What are best practices for compliance management?\n\nWhile the specific practices for compliance management will vary according to industry, there are some best practices for compliance management that any product team can use to ensure a successful product launch.\n\n- Identify compliance officers: If your company doesn\u2019t have a dedicated compliance officer, identify someone on your team who can at least serve as an ad hoc compliance officer. Identifying the right person (or people) early in the development process will give a central point of contact so that no one is wondering who is in charge of compliance.\n- Learn relevant requirements: All members of the team should at least have a familiarity with the regulatory and legal environment around product development. In addition, everyone should subscribe to government and industry mailing lists or websites to stay up-to-date on changes to regulations.\u00a0[One study](https://dynamic.globalscape.com/files/Whitepaper-The-True-Cost-of-Compliance-with-Data-Protection-Regulations.pdf)\u00a0found that regulatory monitoring saved companies an average of $1.03 million.\n- Create a central repository of requirements: Rather than simply documenting requirements that are relevant only to one team or project, companies should create a central source of information for all compliance requirements, including internal procedures and standards. With one central source for all teams to access and contribute to, teams are less likely to miss requirements in the development process.\n- Establish traceability between requirements and standards, regulations, and other relevant compliance documents: By documenting traceability between the compliance requirements and project artifacts, product teams create a robust analysis tool that can provide invaluable detail and information for audits and reviews.\n- Implement tools that support compliance management: While there\u2019s no substitute for having human input and control over compliance management, there\u2019s no question that having the right tools can make compliance a more manageable task. The right tool will support product teams by providing a central source for traceability, requirements management, analysis, documentation, and all related activities.\n\n### What makes a compliance program effective?\n\nA comprehensive and effective compliance program will:\n\n- Reduce costs: When teams have a program in place for comprehensive compliance management, it\u2019s almost inevitable that the team or company will save money overall.\n- Improve risk management: Evaluating and assessing risks throughout the lifecycle will improve risk management across the development lifecycle. Good compliance management will help teams identify and assess risks early in the development process.\n- Keep product development well within organizational GRC framework: An effective compliance program will keep development in compliance with internal controls and the overall organizational GRC framework.\n- Improve speed to market: When compliance is fully integrated into product design and development, the risk of delays drops, and chances of shipping on time or early increase.\n\n### What tools and software can help product teams maintain compliance during the application lifecycle?\n\nA\u00a0**compliance management solution**\u00a0is an important piece of any compliance management system. Within the overall framework of a compliance management system, a compliance management solution will support workflows, self-assessments, surveys, and issue remediation. In addition, intuitive dashboards and charts can provide real-time insights into compliance processes.**\u00a0**\n\n**How can Jama help teams working in highly regulated industries, like medical and aerospace, maintain compliance during the application lifecycle?**\n\nJama Connect gives product teams the tools they need to integrate compliance management into the design lifecycle.

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Process Overview\n\n![This image shows the letters spelling out the acronym FMEA and breaks down what each letter stands for: Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/FMEA-1030x1030.png)\n\n**What is FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)?**\n\nFailure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a structured process for determining potential risks and failures of a product or process during the development phase. FMEA teams examine failure modes\u2014those potential points of failure in a product or process \u2014 and what might be their effects (risks, harm, waste, or defects) for the purpose of mitigating or eliminating these potential failures before release.\n\nProduct development teams have to balance many competing interests. Market competition, customer demands, and stakeholder pressures can combine to tempt teams to rush products to market and skip important steps. But the risk of skipping steps also increases the risk of future failures, recalls, or legal challenges. How can development teams design and develop products that meet safety and regulatory guidelines, satisfy customers, and produce profits for the company?\n\nOne vital piece of the development team\u2019s process is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). But in order to make the best use of FMEA, teams need to understand more than just what it is; they also need to understand why it\u2019s important and how to integrate it fully into the product development process.\n\n### Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Process Overview for Product Teams\n\nFMEA is more than just a one-time event or a prescriptive process meant to be checked off a list. Properly performed, FMEA can improve product quality, reduce costs, and help establish compliance with safety guidelines by helping development teams identify potential failures early in the lifecycle rather during verification or validation (or even post-market!). Performing FMEA also helps capture organizational knowledge around products and preserves information for future development cycles. Finally, collecting data on a new product not only documents what could go wrong with the product, but also what suggestions were rejected, what actions were taken, and what solutions were adopted.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis as highly structured brainstorming. Within the confines of an FMEA structure, team members are encouraged to consider all possibilities for product failure and use team and organizational knowledge to arrive at possible solutions or actions to solve the problems. Instead of being just a template to fill in, proper FMEA is a systematic group of activities intended to:\n\n- Recognize and evaluate potential failures of a product or process;\n- Evaluate the effects of failures;\n- Identify actions which could eliminate or reduce the chance of potential failure; and\n- Document the process and record decisions.\n\nIn this overview, we will review the history and purpose of FMEA, define key terms, and provide an outline for how to perform FMEA as part of the development process.\n\n### What is FMEA?\n\nFirst used in the 1940s, FMEA started as a military process designed to test mission-critical safety. Since then, FMEA has expanded into industries as diverse as automotive, medical devices, and aerospace. As a tool to help mitigate risk and comply with international standards such as ISO 14971, ISO 13485, IATF 16949, and AS9100,\u00a0[FMEA supports many risk management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/answers-to-your-questions-about-risk-management-and-fmea/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\u00a0tasks and helps establish proof of compliance.\n\n### What is a failure mode?\n\nFailure modes are ways that an element, component, system, function, or process can fail. For example, a bicycle hand brake works by creating friction between the rotor and the brake pads. Events that interfere with that friction are failure modes \u2014 for instance, heavy rains might cause a reduction in friction when the brake is applied leading to failure of the brakes.\n\nOnce you know the failure mode, the effects can be determined. Effects are the ways that failures can cause harm, waste, or defects for the customer. In our bicycle example above, failure of brakes could lead to serious injury of the bicycle operator. The analysis piece of FMEA is where failure modes and effects are identified and prioritized so that they can be reduced or eliminated before new product release.\n\n### How are failure modes found?\n\nFailure modes are discovered through testing and brainstorming as part of the development process.**\u00a0**\n\n### How is FMEA calculated?\n\n#### What is a risk priority number (RPN), and how is it used in FMEA?\n\nA risk priority number (RPN) is a number assigned to the specific process or step within a process to quantify the likelihood of detection or probability of occurrence of a failure mode and the severity of its impact. The RPN is the product of three scores: 1) the likelihood of the failure occurring, 2) the likelihood that the failure will\u00a0*not*\u00a0be detected, and 3) the impact of the failure in terms of harm or damage to a person or equipment.\n\nIn FMEA, every failure mode is assigned an RPN. The goal of the FMEA is to reduce the RPN; the higher the risk of severe impact, the more the FMEA process will seek to reduce it before product release or re-release through corrective actions.\n\nFMEA can also simply be calculated by a simple SxO \u2013 severity times occurrence.\n\n### What are the most common types of FMEA?\n\nThere are two types of FMEA that are most common: design FMEA and process FMEA.\n\n#### Design FMEA\n\nIn a design FMEA (dFMEA), the product team reviews potential product malfunction, the possibility of reduced product life, and safety and regulatory concerns. The team looks at every aspect of the product, such as material properties, geometry, tolerances, interfaces with other components or systems, environments, user profile, degradation, and systems interactions.\n\n#### Process FMEA\n\nA process FMEA (pFMEA) looks for possible failures that reduce product quality or reliability and result in customer dissatisfaction. It also looks at safety concerns that might arise from human factors, processing methods, materials, machines, measurement systems, and environmental factors.\n\n#### FMEA Levels and Scope\n\nFMEA is context dependent; a proper analysis can only be performed if the team understands where the process or design feature lives in the overall system.\n\nAt the highest level, a product as a whole is one system. Under that system are sub-systems. Each sub-system has assemblies and/or processes, and each assembly or process has components and/or activities.\n\n![This image shows a graph with circles and lines which point out the different hierarchy of FMEA Levels and Scope.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-11.17.43-AM-1030x734.png)\n\nImage Courtesy of ETI Group 2019\n\nFMEA should be performed at each of these levels and for each item within that level.\n\nWithin each item or level, the FMEA team needs to set the boundary of analysis, or scope. A clear scope will answer the following questions:\n\n- What is our focus\u2014design or debug? (Where is the product on the development-to-launch timeline?)\n- Which item and level is being covered by this FMEA\u2014system, sub-system, component, process, etc.?\n- What triggered this FMEA\u2014changed regulation? Product redesign? New environment?\n- What aspect of design or process are we addressing (reliability, environmental impact, serviceability, etc.)?\n- Who is the customer, and what are the customer requirements?\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [An Interview with Award-Winning Medical Device Risk Management Educator and Author Bijan Elahi](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-management-software/?utm_campaign=related+blog)\n\n### Why perform a FMEA?\n\nFor many companies and product development teams, the biggest worry around product release is a major misstep that results in harm to users, bad publicity,\u00a0[recalls](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/avoid-product-recall-and-failure-with-better-requirements-and-risk-management/), product corrections, lawsuits, or worse. But even smaller product issues can erode a company\u2019s reputation and bottom line. If engineers and customer service teams spend their time fighting product fires and resolving customer complaints, they aren\u2019t spending time designing new features and products to drive company growth.\n\n![This image shows time over number graph with visuals that represent the FMEA Design and Development Process.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-11.16.26-AM-1030x651.png)\n\nImage Courtesy of ETI Group 2019\n\nMaking an FMEA procedure a routine piece of the product development process moves risk assessment to an early part of the development cycle. It helps ensure that risks are reduced early in the process, saving time, money, and reputation in the long run. Performing FMEA early in the process allows teams to think critically about potential design and process failures when it\u2019s still possible to control risks, costs, and reputation.\n\nThe time to control costs is early in the development process, before costs are incurred. Failure Modes and Effects Analysis helps companies accurately evaluate and plan for costs by providing a structured way to evaluate and analyze potential risks and failures.\n\n![In this graph, we show a visual representation of the FMEA Lifetime Product Costs vs. Phases of Product Life which contain Concept, Design, Testing, Development, and Product phases.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-11.16.41-AM-1030x663.png)\n\nProduct cost vs. time graphic\u2014Dr. David M. Anderson, Design for Manufacturability: Optimizing Cost, Quality, and Time-to-Market\n\n### When should we perform a FMEA?\n\nFMEA is a proactive tool to use any time you are:\n\n- Developing a brand new design, technology, or process;\n- Modifying an existing design or process;\n- Changing the environment, location, application, or usage profile of a design or process; or\n- Responding to a change in regulation affecting a design or process.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to remember that FMEA is a continuous process, not a one-time event. In fact, it is most effective when it is implemented at different times for different objectives across the development cycle. For best results, gather as many cross-functional minds as possible. This is not a call to have everyone in the company involved at every stage, but rather to gather people with different perspectives and insights who can focus on one system or sub-system at a time.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Compliance Management](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/meeting-regulatory-compliance-and-industry-standards/understanding-iso-standardslibrary/requirements-management-guide/meeting-regulatory-compliance-and-industry-standards/compliance-management)\n\n### What is the FMEA process? How should we perform an FMEA?\n\nWhile FMEA can seem overly structured at first, in reality, this structure is actually one of its valuable strengths. Within the FMEA structure, teams have the ability to ask questions, provide insights, and brainstorm solutions in a way that captures knowledge for the organization and improves product performance and safety at the same time.\n\nBut while the structure is a great strength of FMEA, it can be daunting for teams that have little experience with it.\n\n![This image portrays a graph of FMEA Sessions broken down by the following topics: Scoping, Severity, Occurrence, Detection RPN, Actions, and Evaluation.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-11.26.15-AM-1030x730.png)\n\nImage Courtesy of ETI Group 2019\n\nHere is an orderly way to approach FMEA:\n\n**Step 1: Prepare the FMEA document.**\u00a0Typically, this step can be done by a single person familiar with the design or process being analyzed\u2014a member of the design team, for example. The temptation is to make this document too large or too encompassing. Remember, it should include only one system or sub-system or even one process or attribute at a time.\n\n**Step 2: Invite the team.**\u00a0This step can happen concurrently with step one. A member of the product team should form a non-permanent team of four to six people from inside and outside the development team. Your cross-functional team might include people from procurement, planning, finance, sales, marketing, and production\u2014and, of course, the customer or end user.\n\n**Step 3: Input information.**\u00a0When the team is assembled and the document is in place, it\u2019s time to brainstorm. Look at all potential failure modes. \u00a0Evaluate potential causes, risks, and potential effects of the failure mode, and fill them in accordingly on the FMEA document.\n\n**Step 4: Assign RPNs.** Calculating and assigning RPNs can often happen concurrently with the inputting of information, but if it doesn\u2019t, be sure that these are assigned before moving on to prioritizing and brainstorming solutions.\n\n**Step 5: Prioritize failure modes.**\u00a0The failure modes with the highest RPNs are the most high-risk failure modes and should be evaluated and reviewed first.\n\n**Step 6: Coordinate with other teams.**\u00a0Of course, it\u2019s preferable to have many FMEA teams reviewing systems, sub-systems, and other items within each level at the same time. Teams should be sure to coordinate with each other. If one team\u2019s solution actually causes another team\u2019s failure mode, or if one team\u2019s effect could mean a consequence for another team\u2019s system, it\u2019s important to discover that as early in the development cycle as possible.\n\n**Step 7: Integrate with requirements management and compliance and regulatory guidance.**\u00a0As FMEA teams complete their analyses and resolve potential failures, those results should be integrated into the requirements management process and relevant safety and compliance guidelines. Using a requirements management tool such as Jama Connect, teams are able to link FMEA items directly to sources of potential failure and to mitigating requirements or verifications.\n\n![In this image, we see a visual representation of the FMEA Process Terms and Definitions such as rating factors (Occurrence, Detection, and Severity) plus terms such as Control, Prevent, Detect, Cause, Failure Mode, Effects, and Consequences.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2021-04-28-at-11.22.59-AM-1030x746.png)\n\nImage courtesy of ETI Group 2019\n\n#### \n\n####\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Avoid the Most Common Challenges of the Design History File](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/avoid-the-most-common-challenges-of-the-design-history-file/)\n\n### Are there templates for running an FMEA?\n\nThere are many templates available for running an FMEA.

FMEA teams examine failure modes\u2014those potential points of failure in a product or process \u2014 and what might be their effects (risks, harm, waste, or defects) for the purpose of mitigating or eliminating these potential failures before release.\n\nProduct development teams have to balance many competing interests. Market competition, customer demands, and stakeholder pressures can combine to tempt teams to rush products to market and skip important steps. But the risk of skipping steps also increases the risk of future failures, recalls, or legal challenges. How can development teams design and develop products that meet safety and regulatory guidelines, satisfy customers, and produce profits for the company?\n\nOne vital piece of the development team\u2019s process is Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). But in order to make the best use of FMEA, teams need to understand more than just what it is; they also need to understand why it\u2019s important and how to integrate it fully into the product development process.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Failure Mode and Effects Analysis Process Overview for Product Teams", "level": 3, "content": "FMEA is more than just a one-time event or a prescriptive process meant to be checked off a list. Properly performed, FMEA can improve product quality, reduce costs, and help establish compliance with safety guidelines by helping development teams identify potential failures early in the lifecycle rather during verification or validation (or even post-market!). Performing FMEA also helps capture organizational knowledge around products and preserves information for future development cycles. Finally, collecting data on a new product not only documents what could go wrong with the product, but also what suggestions were rejected, what actions were taken, and what solutions were adopted.\n\nIt can be helpful to think of Failure Mode and Effects Analysis as highly structured brainstorming. Within the confines of an FMEA structure, team members are encouraged to consider all possibilities for product failure and use team and organizational knowledge to arrive at possible solutions or actions to solve the problems.

For example, a bicycle hand brake works by creating friction between the rotor and the brake pads.

Effects are the ways that failures can cause harm, waste, or defects for the customer. In our bicycle example above, failure of brakes could lead to serious injury of the bicycle operator.

Systems engineers analyze the collection of pieces to make sure when working together, they achieve the intended objectives or purpose of the product. For example, in automotive development, a propulsion system or braking system will involve mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, and a host of other specialized engineering disciplines. A systems engineer will focus on making each of the individual systems work together into an integrated whole that performs as expected across the lifecycle of the product.\n\nIn this chapter, we discuss:\n\n- The fundamentals of systems engineering\n- The role of a systems engineer\n- Systems engineering process\n- The \u201cV\u201d Model of systems engineering\n\n### What are the fundamentals of systems engineering?\n\nIn product development, systems engineering is the interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing, integrating, and managing the systems that work together to form a more complex system. Systems engineering is based around systems thinking principles, and the goal of a systems engineer is to help a product team produce an engineered system that performs a useful function as defined by the requirements written at the beginning of the project. The final product should be one where the individual systems work together in a cohesive whole that meet the requirements of the product.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/Fundamentals-1030x818.png)\n\n### What is a system?\n\nA system is a collection of different elements that produce results that individual elements cannot produce. Elements or parts can be wide-ranging and include people, hardware, software, facilities, policies, and documents. These elements interact with each other according to a set of rules that produce a unified whole with a purpose expressed by its functioning. An example of a system is the human auditory system; the system includes individual parts in the form of bones and tissue that interact in a way to produce sound waves, which are transferred to nerves that lead to the brain, which interprets the sounds and formulates a response. If any single part in the auditory system fails or experiences disruption, the entire system can fail to perform its function.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Complete Guide to the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge (SEBoK)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/ebook/the-complete-guide-to-the-systems-engineering-body-of-knowledge-sebok)\n\n### What is systems thinking?\n\nSystems thinking is a way of thinking that looks at the overall function of a complex system rather than breaking it down into smaller parts. For example, systems thinking would consider an automobile a complex system that consists of smaller, specialized elements. While an electrical engineer might only be concerned with the electrical system of the automobile, someone looking at the entire complex system would consider how the electrical system would impact other systems in the automobile \u2014 and how those other systems might impact the electrical system. If one piece of the electrical system fails, for instance, how would that failure cascade to other systems to impact the operability of the automobile? Systems thinking will take a \u201cbig picture\u201d approach to the overall product.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success. Get started with a free 30-day trial, or book a demo!\n\nFREE 30-DAY TRIAL\n\nBOOK A DEMO\n\n### What is the role of a systems engineer?\n\nA systems engineer is tasked with looking at the entire integrated system and evaluating it against its desired outcomes. In that role, the systems engineer must know a little bit about everything and have an ability to see the \u201cbig picture.\u201d While specialists can focus on their specific disciplines, the systems engineer must evaluate the complex system as a whole against the initial requirements and desired outcomes.\n\nSystems engineers have multi-faceted roles to play but primarily assist with:\n\n- Design compatibility\n- Definition of requirements\n- Management of projects\n- Cost analysis\n- Scheduling\n- Possible maintenance needs\n- Ease of operations\n- Future systems upgrades\n- Communication among engineers, managers, suppliers, and customers in regards to the system\u2019s operations\n\n### How can systems engineers help improve traceability?\n\nFor many systems engineers, balancing the needs of the individual systems and their engineers against the system as a whole results in addressing problems after the fact, holding unwanted meetings, and trying to persuade others to change behavior. Many organizations may not adequately focus on requirements and traceability, resulting in a lack of data that would allow a systems engineer to better evaluate the product.\n\nTo avoid constantly chasing problems and start streamlining processes, [systems engineers can use three best practices](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/systems-engineers-career-path-how-to-elevate):\n\n- **Baseline the current traceability performance:** Traceability spans the product development process, and product team members understand the value of data management, especially as concerns meeting industry requirements. By establishing a baseline of traceability performance, the entire team will be able to see existing risks and potential savings and improvements. In addition, a baseline can give a foundation for a plan of action to move toward Live Traceability.\n- **Build the business case for Live Traceability:** With a baseline in hand, systems engineers can offer a case for moving to Live Traceability based on data. The data can establish the ROI, productivity improvements, and risk reduction of moving from static traceability to Live Traceability.\n- **Create quick wins:** Once the advantages of Live Traceability are established, the systems engineer can set up continuous syncing between requirements and task management programs, thus automating traceability from requirements to user stories. This simple shift can help demonstrate the value of shifting from after-the-fact traceability to Live Traceability.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Ensure Product Quality with These Review Process Best Practices](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/ensure-product-quality-with-these-review-process-best-practices-2)\n\n### What is the Systems Engineering Process?\n\nThe systems engineering process can take a top-down approach, bottoms up, or middle out depending on the system being developed. The process encompasses all creative, manual, and technical activities necessary to define the ultimate outcomes and see that the development process results in a product that meets objectives.\n\nThe process typically has four basic steps:\n\n- **Task definition/analysis/conceptual:** In this step, the systems engineer works with stakeholders to understand their needs and constraints. This stage could be considered a creative or idea stage where brainstorming takes place and market analysis and end user desires are included.\n- **Design/requirements:** In this phase, individual engineers and team members analyze the needs in step 1 and translate them into requirements that describe how the system needs to work. The systems engineer evaluates the systems as a whole and offers feedback to improve integration and overall design.\n- **Create traceability:** Although we\u2019re listing traceability here as the third step, traceability is actually created throughout the lifecycle of development and is not a discrete activity taking place during one phase. Throughout the lifecycle of development, the team works together to design individual systems that will integrate into one cohesive whole. The systems engineer helps manage traceability and integration of the individual systems.\n- **Implementation/market launch:** When everyone has executed their roles properly, the final product is manufactured or launched with the assurance that it will operate as expected in a complex system throughout its anticipated life cycle.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/Systems-Engineering-Process.gif)\n\n### The\u201cV\u201dDiagram of Systems Engineering\n\nDeveloped in the 1980s, the \u201cV\u201d Diagram of Systems Engineering is a way of specifying the specific series of steps that make up a systems engineering approach. While it was originally employed in a pre-Agile environment, it still has [relevance to product development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-v-model/) today and can enable faster, less risky product development.\n\nThe \u201cV\u201d diagram allows system engineers multiple viewpoints and opportunities to evaluate systems as they integrate with each other. This approach starts with the desired outcomes and objectives and then deconstructs them into individual systems and system components for the purpose of design. Once the requirements and design details are established, individual systems can be tested and evaluated, then integrated into the overall piece for testing and verification. As the systems are integrated and become closer to the final complex system, teams have multiple opportunities to validate and verify concepts, requirements, and design.\n\nFor the systems engineer, the \u201cV\u201d Model can give a clear roadmap that allows the breakdown of the complex system into smaller parts and then the reintegration and reassembly of the pieces into a cohesive whole. With systems broken down to individual components, traceability, requirements management, and testing and validation become more manageable. In addition, as the pieces are reintegrated into the whole system, the \u201cV\u201d Model allows for an iterative process that gives a clearer view into potential risks and helps troubleshoot problems.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/V-Model.png)\n\nSystems engineering is a discipline that\u2019s vital to the success of a complex system. By including systems engineers in all stages of product development and requirements management, teams can reduce risks, improve time to market, and produce better products that more adequately meet end user requirements.\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn More About Key Systems Engineering Skills\n\nDEFINITION OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND A SYSTEMS ENGINEER:\n\n**Systems Engineering** is an engineering field that takes an interdisciplinary approach to product development. **Systems Engineers** analyze the collection of pieces to make sure when working together, they achieve the intended objectives or purpose of the product.", "sections": [{"heading": "What is Systems Engineering?", "level": 2, "content": "Systems Engineering is an engineering field that takes an interdisciplinary approach to product development.

A Guide to Streamlined Teamwork and Innovation\n\nEfficient collaboration is the cornerstone of successful engineering projects. As systems become increasingly complex, engineers must navigate communication barriers, integrate diverse tools, and maintain alignment within cross-functional teams. Research indicates that poor collaboration and miscommunication account for up to 30% of project delays and failures in engineering fields. Additionally, a study by McKinsey reveals that organizations with highly collaborative teams are 20% more likely to meet performance goals and adhere to project timelines. [Source](https://www.mckinsey.com/)\n\nWithout effective collaboration, critical issues like missed requirements and delayed timelines can arise, highlighting the importance of structured communication and teamwork in engineering success.\n\n*TL;DR: Collaborative tools and strategies dramatically enhance engineering outcomes by fostering alignment, improving efficiency, and minimizing errors.*\n\n![Drawing of river and a bridge from an above perspective showing how effective collaboration is how engineers navigate difficult project development.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/08/Efficient-collaboration-1030x788.png)\n\n### Engineer Collaboration: The Challenges\n\nBefore understanding solutions, let\u2019s address the common collaboration hurdles engineering teams face:\n\nEngineering teams often work in environments requiring high levels of precision, creativity, and coordination. However, these teams are frequently composed of individuals with diverse specializations, spanning software, hardware, design, and more. This cross-disciplinary nature, while invaluable, introduces complexities when aligning goals, priorities, and processes. Additionally, many engineering projects are fast-paced and rely on iterative development cycles, leaving little room for miscommunication or errors. Without strong collaboration, teams can find themselves working in silos, leading to mismatched expectations, delayed deliverables, or even product failures. The increasing reliance on remote work and distributed teams has further amplified these challenges, adding physical and temporal separation to the equation. Therefore, addressing collaboration challenges head-on is not just beneficial \u2014 it is essential to ensure engineering teams can deliver high-quality results efficiently.\n\n### 1: Communication Silos\n\nPoor communication within teams can lead to misunderstandings and inefficiencies that hinder overall performance. Communication silos occur when individuals or groups within an organization fail to openly share information, updates, or feedback with other stakeholders. This lack of transparency can result in duplicated efforts, overlooked details, and a misalignment of goals. For engineering teams, these silos could mean that crucial design considerations or development updates are not relayed effectively, leading to issues later in the workflow. To overcome communication silos, it is crucial to foster a culture of openness and encourage regular updates between all team members. Implementing collaborative tools like shared workspaces, messaging platforms, and regular stand-up meetings can help bridge gaps and create a more cohesive flow of information. By breaking down these barriers, teams can ensure better alignment and improved outcomes.\n\n### 2: Fragmented Data\n\nThis fragmentation often leads to confusion, as team members may struggle to determine which version of a document is the most up-to-date or accurate. It can also result in wasted time as employees search through numerous platforms or rely on incomplete or outdated information to make decisions. To address this issue, organizations should aim to consolidate documentation into a centralized repository, ensuring that all relevant data is easily accessible and consistently maintained. Leveraging tools that integrate with existing workflows can further streamline this process, reducing the time spent navigating between platforms and minimizing the risk of errors. Establishing clear guidelines for document management and assigning ownership for updates can also help maintain consistency and reliability across teams.\n\n### 3: Requirement Traceability Issues\n\nEffective requirement traceability begins with establishing a well-defined process that links requirements to their corresponding design, implementation, and testing phases. This ensures that all requirements are accounted for at every stage of the project lifecycle. Utilizing specialized tools, such as requirement management software, can greatly enhance traceability by automating the tracking process and providing real-time updates. Additionally, creating a detailed traceability matrix allows teams to visualize the relationships between requirements and project deliverables, making it easier to identify gaps or misalignments. Regular audits and reviews of the traceability framework can further solidify compliance and maintain high-quality outputs, ensuring that no requirement is overlooked or improperly addressed.\n\n### 4: Inefficient Review Cycles\n\nLengthy, manual approval processes hinder project agility and can lead to significant delays in meeting deadlines. When review cycles are not streamlined, teams may encounter bottlenecks, miscommunication, or redundant feedback, which slows progress and reduces overall productivity. To address this, organizations should consider implementing automated workflows or approval tools that enable faster decision-making and transparent collaboration. Establishing clear review timelines and assigning designated reviewers can also enhance efficiency by ensuring that tasks are addressed promptly and consistently. By optimizing review cycles, teams can maintain momentum, minimize delays, and deliver high-quality results within the desired timeframe.\n\n*Key Insight: Addressing collaboration challenges enables teams to focus on innovation instead of fighting organizational inefficiencies.*\n\n![Four part chart listing out the main challenges in engineer collaboration: communication silos, fragmented data, requirements traceability issues, and inefficient review cycles.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/08/Engineer-Collaboration-The-Challenges-1027x1030.png)\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirements Traceability \u2013 How to Go Live](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirements-traceability-how-to-go-live/)\n\n### Actionable Collaboration Strategies for Engineers\n\n### 1.

And at the same time, [93%](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/industry-digitization/how-to-develop-products-from-a-data-driven-perspective) of organizations say they feel like they need to make faster and better decisions relative to their competitors. As technology continues to evolve, customer demands increase, and so too does the pressure placed on those in systems engineering \u2014 an occupation that [steadily adds new jobs](https://www.comptia.org/blog/your-next-move-system-engineer#:~:text=From%202016%20to%202026%2C%20the,during%20that%2010%2Dyear%20period.) each year.\n\nSystems engineers increasingly work in a plug-and-play world that includes complex products and the need to build more resilient systems. Engineers are skilled at solving problems and innovating, but that doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t challenged with navigating this fast-changing-environment.\n\n### What Is the Systems Engineering Body of Knowledge?\n\nThe SEBoK is [organized into wiki pages](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/SEBoK_Table_of_Contents) and includes a variety of resources about systems engineering topics. Three organizations collaborated to create the resource:\n\n- The International Council of Systems Engineering\n- The IEEE Systems Council\n- The Stevens Institute of Technology\n\nThe original SEBoK was developed over a three-year period, from 2009 to 2012. Over 70 different authors from around the world collaborated on the document. New information is constantly added since it\u2019s intended to be a living, breathing resource, with the most recent update published during October 2021.\n\nThe SEBoK doesn\u2019t contain the information in itself, but it\u2019s a resource that directs people to the best possible sources for specific content areas. Think about it like a library catalog. If you want to learn more about a specific subject, the library catalog doesn\u2019t provide you with the actual information, but instead directs you to books, articles and other resources to find that content.\n\nNote: While this eBook helps clearly outline the SEBoK, if you are interested in reading the entire living document, you can find that here: [SEBoK Table of Contents](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/SEBoK_Table_of_Contents)\n\n### Who Uses the SEBoK?\n\nThe most obvious audience for the SEBoK is systems engineers, but the content is actually created for many different audiences \u2014 many of whom aren\u2019t systems engineers. Let\u2019s take a look at who can benefit from this content.\n\n- **Systems engineers.** Whether you\u2019re a novice or an advanced systems engineer, the SEBoK provides references to expand knowledge on various subject areas.\n- **Faculty members**. Universities and colleges want to improve their existing programs and design new ones. The SEBoK is useful to determine what content should be included in the programs.\n- **Certifying organizations.** If a company has an in-house certification program or is a certifying organization, they want to understand what other programs require. The SEBoK provides the required content to make those decisions.\n- **Systems engineers managers.** Managers might want to design better processes and learn how others are doing the work to guide those decisions.\n- **Systems engineer researchers**. A researcher may want to get familiar with a specific content area to guide his or her research or fill in knowledge gaps.\n\nThe above list is mainly of primary SEBoK users, but secondary users can also benefit from the resource. Human resources professionals, for example, might need background information to support the task of hiring new systems engineers. Non-technical managers might need to better understand deliverables called out in a contract. All of these groups can benefit from learning more about the SEBoK.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Comprehensive Guide to Successfully Adopting Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/the-comprehensive-guide-to-successfully-adopting-model-based-systems-engineering-mbse)\n\n### Why Was the SEBoK Created?\n\nThe SEBoK was created with the thought that many failures are the result of not having the correct information at the right time. Creating common ground among users through this resource is an attempt to minimize these failures. The [purpose of the original document](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Scope_of_the_SEBoK), according to the authors of the SEBoK, was to:\n\n- **Create a common understanding among systems engineers.** The living document attempts to forge a common understanding around boundaries, terminology and common practices to improve work in the field.\n- **Forge a common understanding among researchers.** The body of work attempts to help researchers understand systems engineering limitations and guide research and understanding of current principles.\n- **Inform interactions.** There are many people who need a basic level of understanding about systems engineering but who aren\u2019t engineers. The resource was created to provide them with the knowledge they need to complete tasks.\n- **Help curriculum developers.** People are constantly developing new curricula to shape new generations of systems engineers. The SEBoK is designed to provide a common understanding of what engineers need to know.\n- **Inform certifiers.** The resource was created to help people and organizations that certify systems engineers understand what knowledge is needed today and in the future.\n- **Create resources for managers and staff.** People who aren\u2019t engineers are often involved in the hiring of systems engineers. These individuals require basic knowledge so they can assess the skills of a successful systems engineer.\n\nAccess to the SEBoK is free, but the recommended resources often are not. For example, the SEBoK may recommend a specific reference guide that is available for purchase from a publisher. The goal of the SEBoK is to direct the audience to the best possible resources on a given topic \u2014 not to be the resource, but to help readers find the resource.\n\n### Understanding the Eight Parts of the SEBoK\n\n![The eight parts of SEBoK](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/07/SEBoK-Flow.png)\n\nEach part of the document is divided into \u201cknowledge areas,\u201d which are broken down into [eight different themes](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_SEBoK), as follows:\n\n**Part 1: The Introduction **\n\nThe first part of the SEBoK is the introduction, which explains what is included in the document and provides a brief overview of systems engineering in general. It explains who should use the SEBoK and what content areas are included.\n\n**Part 2: The Foundations of System Engineering **\n\nPart two includes an overview of all the areas that make up systems engineering foundations. This foundational section includes an overview of all the principles, models of key areas, and basic foundations of how systems engineering is practiced.\n\n**Part 3: Systems Engineering and Management **\n\nPart three provides general knowledge and practices for systems engineering in the context of management activities. Lifecycle modes are included that relate to the various parts of systems engineering. Part three also covers technical aspects, such as the requirements, architecture, testing, evaluation, and more.\n\n**Part 4: Applications of Systems Engineering **\n\nThe fourth part is focused on how to apply systems engineering principles to a variety of different situations in context. It focuses on products, services, enterprises, and systems of systems, otherwise known as \u201cSoS.\u201d The applications explain the real-world practices of systems engineering.\n\n**Part 5. Enabling Systems Engineering **\n\nPart five is focused on organization. How can you improve organization in a way that ensures improved performance of systems engineering activities? Considerations include the value proposition, business purpose, convergence, competency, and more.\n\n**Part 6. Related Disciplines **\n\nThe sixth part is focused on how systems engineering relates to other principles. For example, the section covers links between systems engineering and software engineering, project management, and more. It\u2019s also focused on how systems engineering links to engineering considerations such as reliability, availability, and maintainability.\n\n**Part 7. Systems Engineering Implementation Examples **\n\nPart seven includes real-world examples of systems engineering in action. This includes case study scenarios, where successes and challenges of systems engineering programs are highlighted. It\u2019s a place to uncover best practices and solutions to navigating specific challenges.\n\n**Part 8: Emerging Knowledge **\n\nPart eight is rooted in the fact that the SEBoK is a living document, and part of it is dedicated to emerging topics that impact the industry.\n\nOn the cutting edge, Jama Software\u00ae is the first organization to measure traceability thanks to our clients\u2019 participation in a benchmarking dataset of over 40,000 complex product development projects spanning aerospace, automotive, consumer electronics, industrial, medical device, semiconductor, space systems, and more.\n\nLearn more about how traceability is measured, and the business practices that separate top-quartile performers from the rest by reading our Requirements Traceability Benchmark: [Requirements Traceability Benchmark](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/requirements-traceability-benchmark)\n\n### What is the role of a systems engineer?\n\nA systems engineer is tasked with looking at the entire integrated system and evaluating it against its desired outcomes. In that role, the systems engineer must know a little bit about everything and have an ability to see the \u201cbig picture.\u201d While specialists can focus on their specific disciplines, the systems engineer must evaluate the complex system as a whole against the initial requirements and desired outcomes.\n\nSystems engineers have multi-faceted roles to play but primarily assist with:\n\n- Design compatibility\n- Definition of requirements\n- Management of projects\n- Cost analysis\n- Scheduling\n- Possible maintenance needs\n- Ease of operations\n- Future systems upgrades\n- Communication among engineers, managers, suppliers, and customers in regards to the system\u2019s operations\n\n### Recent Updates to the SEBoK\n\nKeeping current in a fast-changing landscape isn\u2019t an easy task, so the SEBoK is constantly publishing updates. The most recent update was released in 2021 and included several\n\nchanges.\n\n- The main page was updated. The landing page for the living document was updated so that readers can access the required information faster.\n- An [\u201cEditor\u2019s Corner\u201d](https://www.sebokwiki.org/wiki/Editor%27s_Corner) was created. The previous version had a \u201cLetter from an Editor\u201d section, but that was revised to become the \u201cEditor\u2019s Corner.\u201d The new section is focused on emerging trends in the systems engineering space, such as the metaverse and potential systems impacts.\n- New navigation was added. Older information that was no longer relevant was deleted, and a new navigation structure was added to help people find the content they need faster.\n- Community input was added. Input is constantly gathered from users of the SEBoK and added into the newest versions.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Selecting the Right Requirements Management Solution](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-tool)\n\n### Resources to Manage Increased Complexity\n\nSystems engineers are increasingly required to manage more complex product development, and the SEBoK helps you stay current on relevant content areas.

Model-Based Systems Engineering Explained\n\nIn the following chapter, we will set out to answer some of the most common questions around Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), including: What is MBSE? What is the real intent of MBSE? And is MBSE the same thing as SysML?\n\nEditors Note: This subchapter was written by Lou Wheatcraft, Senior Consultant & Managing Member at Wheatland Consulting, LLC, and current co-chair of the INCOSE Requirements Working Group (RWG).\n\n### What is MBSE?\n\nIf you ask 20 people to define MBSE, you might get 20 different answers. The core of confusion is the word \u201cmodel.\u201d\n\nData-centric Practice of SE Data & Information Model Bidirectional Traceability is critical to document relationships, assess change, and show compliance The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook (SE HB) states that \u201ca model that represents a system and its environment is of particular importance to the systems engineer who must analyze, specify, design, and verify systems, as well as share information with other stakeholders. Different types of models are used to represent systems for different modeling purposes.\u201d\n\nIn the INCOSE SE HB, the word \u201cmodel\u201d shows up over 680 times! The term is used to refer to the various kinds of models, visualizations of the data and information contained the various types of models, as well as documents, diagrams, drawings, or any other representation of a system.\n\nIn this context, a \u201cmodel\u201d can be any representation or abstraction of the system of interest that best suits the purpose for which it was created. Thus, there are various kinds of models including analytical, logical, behavioral, and architectural models, textual descriptions, as well as documents, functional flow diagrams, data flow diagrams, interface diagrams, architectural diagrams, drawings, or any other representation of a system.\n\nThe common denominator of all these representations is that they are all visualizations of the underlying data and information that is used to construct and represent the model.\n\n![MBSE Information Model Showing Data Centric Practice of SE Data Information](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/Data-Flow-Chart.png)\n\nAgain, referring to the INCOSE SE HB:\n\n\u201cMBSE is often contrasted with a traditional document-based approach to SE. In a document-based SE approach, there is often considerable information generated about the system that is contained in documents and other artifacts such as specifications, interface control documents, system description documents, trade studies, analysis reports, and verification plans, procedures, and reports. The information contained within these documents is often difficult to maintain and synchronize, and difficult to assess in terms of its quality (correctness, completeness, and consistency).\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an MBSE approach, much of this information is captured [electronically] in a system model or set of models. The system model is a primary artifact of the SE process. MBSE formalizes the application of SE through the use of models. The degree to which this information is captured in models and maintained throughout the life cycle depends on the scope of the MBSE effort. Leveraging an MBSE approach to SE is intended to result in significant improvements in system requirements, architecture, and design quality; lower the risk and cost of system development by surfacing issues early in the system definition; enhance productivity through reuse of system artifacts; and improve communications among the system development team.\u201d\n\nGiven there can be multiple types of models, and visualizations of the data and information in those models generated while progressing through the system life cycle processes, a 10,000-foot level view of SE from a data-centric perspective helps stakeholders understand the context in which various artifacts and their underlying data and information are generated and used.\n\nMBSE is not really about drawing diagrams that contain boxes and lines but rather is about the underlying data and information model itself that enables consistency across the data and information that represents the various models and visualizations.\n\n### What is the Real Intent of MBSE?\n\nThe goal of an organization adopting MBSE is to move from a 20th century document-centric practice of systems engineering (SE) toward a data-centric practice of SE to realize the real intent of MBSE which is to develop, maintain, and manage a data and information model of the system being developed along with a model of all the system life cycle process activities, resulting artifacts, and their underlying data and information.\n\n\u201cMBSE, from a data-centric perspective, involves the formalized application of shareable sets of data to represent the SE work products and underlying data and information generated to support lifecycle concept maturation, needs and requirements definition, design, analysis, and verification and validation activities throughout the system life cycle, from conceptual design to retirement.\u201d1\n\nWith this data-centric perspective of SE, the capability to capture, manage, access data, and manage the interrelationships between SE work products can be accomplished through a variety of methodologies, which range from the establishment of a single relational database to a virtually integrated, but distributed, database by means of a federation (or data map/ index) of disparate data sources.\n\nThis data and information can be captured using a variety of SE tools and applications. To effectively manage the development of our ever-increasing complex, software-centric systems there are benefits to managing this underlying data and information in such a way it can be shared across the system lifecycle process activities, shared between the various SE tools used to create and manage this data and information, and shared between organizations involved in the development and operations of the system of interest. This sharing will help ensure correctness, consistency, and completeness of the data and information typical of our ever increasingly complex systems. It will also enable collaboration between not only the project team members, but also external stakeholders involved in the development of the system.\n\nTo manage the development of increasingly complex software-centric systems, managing data in a way that can be shared across the system lifecycle process activities, and between all key stakeholders involved, can ensure consistency and correctness.\n\nSE cannot be effectively practiced when viewed from just one perspective (requirements, models, patterns, standards, industry specific application, etc.). To successfully practice SE, wise systems engineers recognize and use each perspective as appropriate to the activity they are performing. Based on their needs they choose the appropriate tool and visualization that will meet their needs.\n\nThe degree to which the data and information is captured and managed is driven by the needs of the organization and programs from a business and technical perspective based on the size and complexity of their programs, their product line, culture, processes, workforce, their diversity and complexity of supply chains, and types of engineering information that comprises a technical baseline for their system of interest.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Adopting MBSE Part I: Key Factors Associated with Successful MBSE Adoption](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/adopting-mbse-part-i-key-factors-associated-with-successful-mbse-adoption)\n\n### MBSE is NOT SysML!\n\nTo some practitioners, MBSE is equated to the use of SysML and other language-based modeling tools. However, as discussed above, MBSE is much more than using language-based modeling tools to develop analytical, logical, behavioral, and architectural models. To others, what they are calling MBSE is really Model-based Design (MBD).\n\nMBD design starts with a set of requirements and using various language-based modeling tools to architect and design a system, develop simulations to assess the behavior of the system, and then develop a set of design output specifications to which the system is built or coded. Often the MBD activities are completed in a silo separate from the other SE lifecycle process activities.\n\nHowever, this approach does not address the true intent of MBSE. The data and information model that must be developed must represent all the SE artifacts generated during the product development process activities across all lifecycle stage activities. Thus, information associated with the elicitation of stakeholder needs and requirements, lifecycle concept definition, analysis, and maturation, deriving an integrated set of needs, and transforming those needs into sets of design input requirements, defining an architecture, designing the system, verification the system meets those requirements, and validation that the system meets the needs must also be captured within the data and information model. In addition, relationships and dependencies of the individual data items must be captured (traceability) in order to help determine and ensure consistency across all lifecycle stages as well as help assess the impact of changes made to any of the data items. Design inputs must be traceable to design outputs.\n\n### Benefits of Implementing Systems Engineering from a Data-Centric Perspective\n\n![Image of person standing in front of a scenario depicting MBSE in action.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/MBSE-1030x1030.png)\n\nA data-centric perspective of SE complements the system life cycle process activities by enabling the opportunity for system development with increased quality, lower cost, and lower risk. Adopting MBSE and implementing a data-centric perspective enables organizations to realize the following benefits:\n\n- Meet the challenges associated with increasing complexity for current and future systems discussed in the previous section.\n- Provide greater consistency of all products because any single piece of design data and information can be expressed authoritatively within integrated/federated, shareable sets of data that can later be referred to by others for decisions or formation of other work products.\n- Provide better visibility into the principal characteristics of the whole integrated system because multiple views from the data and information model can be created that succinctly address specific stakeholder needs, concerns, and interests.\n- Provide greater congruence and configuration management between documentation and reality. Differing views of the underlying data and information model can be automatically generated into SE artifacts, reducing the effort to keep the artifacts and their underlying data and information up to date and consistent, resulting in artifacts that match the best available, current data and information.\n- Establish \u201csingle source of truth.\u201d Single source of truth (SSoT) represents the official state or baseline version of data and information \u2014 regardless of what someone says or thinks, no matter what they \u201cremember\u201d or what perspective they have concerning what is being done or built or a decision that was made, if it isn\u2019t in the project\u2019s configuration managed, data and information model, it isn\u2019t the truth. (Requires all the underlying data and information to be configuration managed and kept current and consistent.)\n- Facilitate the navigation, traceability, and interrogation of data and information across all system life cycle stage activities. Managers and engineers can have access to the correct, complete, and consistent data and information more quickly, and on an as-needed basis, without going through manual distribution or search processes.\n- Enable the reuse of SE and PM artifacts and underlying data and information. Considerable time and expense can be saved when an organization can reuse SE and PM data and information and not have to start from scratch for each new project (brown field systems). This reuse ability is key to effective product line management.\n- Facilitate the management of the stakeholder needs, requirement definition, design, build/ code, system verification, and system validation activities in an integrated, consistent manner. Data and information associated with verification and validation activities across all system life cycle process activities can have higher quality and provide greater insight concerning the status of verification and validation activities. This makes it easier to show compliance and that stakeholder needs are being met.\n- Reduce the costs associated with erroneous design and resulting rework. Analysis of the SE work products and underlying data and information can reveal a flaw or inconsistency as soon as it is created, enabling correction before downstream work is done, work that would be invalid, and costly and time consuming to correct if the upstream mistake were not corrected immediately. This also helps to avoid huge expenses associated with recalls, returns, warranty work, and negative comments on social media.\n- Facilitate the identification of interactions (interfaces), helping to ensure the system of interest can be successfully integrated into the macro system it is a part and reducing integration issues and costly rework and schedule slips associated with these issues.\n- Provide identification, management, interoperability, and integration of artifacts and underlying data and information across business or organizational elements needed to support program budget and schedule goals. For example, with the ability to metatag data, information, and work products, they can directly be linked to the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), budget, schedule, and risk management activities.\n- Ensure data and information needed by programs and projects (e.g., for milestones, gate reviews, mission operations, risk mitigation, and anomaly investigations, decisions, and outcomes) are identified and managed to provide traceability of the data and information used in decision-making.\n- Use measures to better manage SE activities across all system life cycle process activities. Measures allow managers and systems engineers to monitor trends, assess progress, identify issues to help ensure the system being developed will meet stakeholder needs and expectations.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Eliminating Barriers to MBSE Adoption with Jama Software\u2019s Traceable MBSE\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/eliminating-barriers-to-mbse-adoption-with-jama-softwares-companion-mbse)\n\n### In Conclusion\n\nIn order to effectively develop today\u2019s increasingly complex and software intensive systems and avoid the many negative consequences of the outdated document-centric practice of SE, organizations must move to a data-centric practice of SE which is the real intent of MBSE. Organizations need to develop a level of organizational SE capability that will enable them to realize the benefits listed above.\n\nSince one size doesn\u2019t fit all, an organization needs to assess the SE capabilities that best fit its domain, product line (degree of complexity), and culture. The level of SE capability an organization establishes needs to be tailored to the size and complexity of systems developed by the organization, whether small, medium, or large projects.\n\nBased on the needs of the organization and the level of SE capability, they will need to choose the appropriate SE toolset, update their processes, and train their people in these tools and processes.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n\u00b9 INCOSE INCOSE-TP-2018-001-01, 2018, Integrated Data as a Foundation of Systems Engineering, prepared by the Requirements Working Group, INCOSE.\n\n2 INCOSE-TP-2010-006-03, 2019, Guide to Writing Requirements, prepared by the Requirements Working Group, INCOSE.\n\n3 Wheatcraft, L., Ryan, M., Dick, J., Llorens, J., 2019. \u201cThe Need for an Information-based Approach to Requirement Development and Management\u201d, paper and poster presentation at INCOSE IS 2019.\n\nDEFINITION OF MBSE:\n\n**MBSE** stands for Model-Based Systems Engineering.\n\nPREVIOUSDigital Engineering Between Government and Contractors\n\nNEXT UPAutomotive Development\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

The core of confusion is the word \u201cmodel.\u201d\n\nData-centric Practice of SE Data & Information Model Bidirectional Traceability is critical to document relationships, assess change, and show compliance The INCOSE Systems Engineering Handbook (SE HB) states that \u201ca model that represents a system and its environment is of particular importance to the systems engineer who must analyze, specify, design, and verify systems, as well as share information with other stakeholders. Different types of models are used to represent systems for different modeling purposes.\u201d\n\nIn the INCOSE SE HB, the word \u201cmodel\u201d shows up over 680 times! The term is used to refer to the various kinds of models, visualizations of the data and information contained the various types of models, as well as documents, diagrams, drawings, or any other representation of a system.\n\nIn this context, a \u201cmodel\u201d can be any representation or abstraction of the system of interest that best suits the purpose for which it was created. Thus, there are various kinds of models including analytical, logical, behavioral, and architectural models, textual descriptions, as well as documents, functional flow diagrams, data flow diagrams, interface diagrams, architectural diagrams, drawings, or any other representation of a system.\n\nThe common denominator of all these representations is that they are all visualizations of the underlying data and information that is used to construct and represent the model.\n\n![MBSE Information Model Showing Data Centric Practice of SE Data Information](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/01/Data-Flow-Chart.png)\n\nAgain, referring to the INCOSE SE HB:\n\n\u201cMBSE is often contrasted with a traditional document-based approach to SE. In a document-based SE approach, there is often considerable information generated about the system that is contained in documents and other artifacts such as specifications, interface control documents, system description documents, trade studies, analysis reports, and verification plans, procedures, and reports. The information contained within these documents is often difficult to maintain and synchronize, and difficult to assess in terms of its quality (correctness, completeness, and consistency).\u201d\n\n\u201cIn an MBSE approach, much of this information is captured [electronically] in a system model or set of models. The system model is a primary artifact of the SE process. MBSE formalizes the application of SE through the use of models. The degree to which this information is captured in models and maintained throughout the life cycle depends on the scope of the MBSE effort. Leveraging an MBSE approach to SE is intended to result in significant improvements in system requirements, architecture, and design quality; lower the risk and cost of system development by surfacing issues early in the system definition; enhance productivity through reuse of system artifacts; and improve communications among the system development team.\u201d\n\nGiven there can be multiple types of models, and visualizations of the data and information in those models generated while progressing through the system life cycle processes, a 10,000-foot level view of SE from a data-centric perspective helps stakeholders understand the context in which various artifacts and their underlying data and information are generated and used.\n\nMBSE is not really about drawing diagrams that contain boxes and lines but rather is about the underlying data and information model itself that enables consistency across the data and information that represents the various models and visualizations.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is the Real Intent of MBSE?", "level": 3, "content": "The goal of an organization adopting MBSE is to move from a 20th century document-centric practice of systems engineering (SE) toward a data-centric practice of SE to realize the real intent of MBSE which is to develop, maintain, and manage a data and information model of the system being developed along with a model of all the system life cycle process activities, resulting artifacts, and their underlying data and information.\n\n\u201cMBSE, from a data-centric perspective, involves the formalized application of shareable sets of data to represent the SE work products and underlying data and information generated to support lifecycle concept maturation, needs and requirements definition, design, analysis, and verification and validation activities throughout the system life cycle, from conceptual design to retirement.\u201d1\n\nWith this data-centric perspective of SE, the capability to capture, manage, access data, and manage the interrelationships between SE work products can be accomplished through a variety of methodologies, which range from the establishment of a single relational database to a virtually integrated, but distributed, database by means of a federation (or data map/ index) of disparate data sources.\n\nThis data and information can be captured using a variety of SE tools and applications.

For the defense contracting world, THIS is the elephant in the room. The DoD (Department of Defense) wants its Digital Engineering (DE) vision to become a reality and they do realize it cannot happen overnight, so how is this being addressed today?\n\nThe short answer is that the DoD wants their contractors to set up their own DE ecosystems and then exchange deliverables. This is no different than what they have done for the past 50 years but the types of deliverables are changing. Namely, they want DE content to be delivered as models which means SysML, UAF (an enterprise architecture format), Computer Aided Design (CAD) I\u2013 if the government purchased the technical data for this during contracting \u2013 models. The DOD still requires deliverables in Word/PDF/Excel/MS Project for various project management deliverables and engineering analysis that is only representable in textural form as well.\n\n\u201cWithin the new Digital Engineering Ecosystem, there are three possible scenarios for information access between customer and contractor. The scenarios are: 1. Provide access to controlled baselines in contractor environment. This is considered a low IP (Intellectual Property) and data rights loss risk option two. Provide access to controlled baselines in the contractor environment and provide selected models and data in accordance with contract data requirements. This is considered a medium IP and data rights loss risk option 3. Provide all required baseline models and data in accordance with contract data requirements. This is considered a medium-high IP and data rights loss risk option.\u201d \u2013 [(AIA Aerospace whitepaper)](https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/MBE_ConOps_WhitePaper_091918.pdf)\n\n### Nightly Check-in Technique:\n\nPLM tools are deemed the center of the ecosystem since these already have the digital twin information (hardware CAD, configuration management, and product management backbone) in place. Nightly check-ins of files (SysML model, CAD, requirements, Ansys, etc.) are thought to be timely enough to keep things in sync. With this model, both the government and contractors would utilize a shared or their own PLM systems.\n\n**SAIC** [ReadyOne](https://www.readyone.net/) \u2013 a ready-made DE ecosystem of tools that can be purchased and installed in one click.

(Cameo, Teamwork Cloud, DNG, Teamcenter, Creo, Jira, GitHub, MySQL, Volta, Matlab/Simulink, Excel) They felt that in most cases Reference Connections were ideal and that reporting and analysis of the digital thread in the Syndeia Cloud webapp was more robust than anything other tool in the marketplace. They felt that *Syndeia Cloud\u2019s export of digital threads relationships into Excel to give to government customers was satisfactory.*\n\n**Their Lessons Learned:**\n\n- Define the Process for creating \u201creference connections\u201d:\n\nWho creates and manages the links.\nDirectionality of the link are consistent. Note: SysML element should always be identified as the source of the link.\n- Identify what types of links (digital threads) you want to create, for example:\n\nCreate reference connections from DNG functional requirement(s) to its SysML <> block to show a <> relationship.\nCreate reference connections from a Teamcenter part/item/assembly to a <> SysML block to show a <> relationship.\n- Establish operational and QA environments for Syndeia:\n\nFor testing out new patches and upgrades.\nQA environment for training/experimentation.\n- Use caution of using \u201cLocal Repositories\u201d (because they are local!)\n- Configuration manage your data repositories:\n\nTeamwork Cloud for Cameo.\nGlobal Configuration Management (GCM) for DNG.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Write Better Requirements with Jama Connect Advisor\u2122](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/write-better-requirements-with-jama-connect-advisor-2?_gl=1*92a02o*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2NzY1Nzk2NjQuQ2owS0NRaUF4YmVmQmhEZkFSSXNBTDRYTFJxOFQ4X29zZHpQc2RSLWtwQVlHaWtWUGU4alJXS0lsWGJPMVBSMEpnOVlXSlg4YlZOOWRVQWFBZ2h3RUFMd193Y0I.*_ga*MjExNTU4NTA3OS4xNjczNDYxMTky*_ga_JQG3M83PDQ*MTY4MTQyMDI4OS4yNjAuMS4xNjgxNDIxMTY3LjYwLjAuMA..)\n\n### Model-Based Acquisition (MBAcq)\n\nAn increasing number of RFPs are not only requiring MBSE but RFPs themselves are now starting to be created as SysML models and responses are expected to be returned in a SysML model file. Yes, there are SysML tool vendors (PTC, Spec Innovations) and even contractors (L3Harris) asking the DoD to drop its language so that the file format is compatible with Cameo. These vendors are trying to ensure they can export and import tool-agnostic SysML that is interoperable with each other.\n\nThe challenge to both the supplier and provider is the lack of standardization in the approach, resulting in a learning curve for every proposal as well as response. To address this concern, the OMG UAF MBAcq Working Group was formed to survey the current landscape with participation from government, industry, FFRDC\u2019s, tool vendors, NDIA, and OMG standards org. The goal is to come up with process guidance and a SE (Systems Engineering) and architecture guidance.\n\n**Planned Deliverables:**\n\n- ARM template and guidance (how to specify model-based DIDs, CDRLs.)\n- GRM template and guidance (includes guidance for how NOT to over-specify a system.)\n- Sample model (as part of UAF sample model.)\n- UAF Process Guide for Acquisition will:\n\nDefine the CONOPS for how a program office will use all the models they will receive over the lifetime or a system.\nDemonstrate how to make models available for reuse for other/new systems.\nProvide portfolio management for the models/programs.\nProvide process and guidance that describes how to integrate MBSE approaches into pre-acquisition (before request for proposal release), request for proposal, contract award, and contract execution steps.\n- Impact to existing policy with recommendations for change.\n- Descriptions of what Sections K, L, and M could look like for model delivery.\n- Taxonomies with precise definitions for concepts and terms.\n\n![Digital Engineering](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2023/04/Digital-Engineering-Chart-NDIA-1030x577.webp)\n\n### Digital Engineering Tool Suites\n\n[According to SBE Vision](https://www.sbevision.com/), digital engineering tools are a mixed bag of silos:\n\n- Not all tools lend themselves to remote linking data at rest.\n- Some tools don\u2019t have a web server.\n- Many detail design tools require a \u201clocal\u201d model data as a basis for initial processing.\n- Sometimes a transformative capability of some kind is needed.\n- Certain use cases require a mashup of three or more systems.\n\n### Two Worlds Apart\n\nSBE Vision is also developing techniques for both OSLC and synced data approaches. Complications can arise from linking vs syncing, such as company product, use case dependent, and can change over time.\n\n**OSLC \u2013 Linked Data:**\n\n- Remote linking of data\n- Peer-to-peer\n- Human-oriented\n- Benefits:\n\nData stays at rest\nClean paradigm\nStandards\n- Challenges:\n\nSemantics (relational)\nConfiguration management\nChange management\nConsistency of standards implementation\n\nSynchronization\n\n- Creating (temporary) copies of data\n- Hub-and-spoke\n- Human & machine Oriented\n- Benefits:\n\nEnables many use cases\nSimple, easy to use\nRich transformation when needed\n- Challenges:\n\nSemantics (relational & transformative)\nConfiguration management\nChange management\nManaging correlation/sync state\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJama Connect enables real-time team collaboration through traceability and digital threads.

It was published in 2011 and updated in 2018, with the goal of providing a systematic and structured approach to ensure functional safety of electrical and/or electronic systems within road vehicles. The standard is applicable to all parts of the vehicle\u2019s electrical and electronic (E/E) systems, including hardware, software, and their integration.\n\nIn recent years, there have been updates to the ISO 26262 standard, specifically in the form of new guidelines and recommended practices. In this article, we will explore the basics of the ISO 26262 standard, as well as the recent updates and their impact on the automotive industry.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Impact of ISO 26262 on Automotive Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/the-impact-of-iso-26262-on-automotive-development)\n\n### What is ISO 26262?\n\n![This image shows a car with a large green checkmark next to it, indicating it has followed safety guidelines, such as ISO 26262.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/09/ISO-26262-1030x1030.png)\n\nISO 26262 is a functional safety standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) for road vehicles. The standard provides a framework for developing, testing, and validating the safety of E/E systems in vehicles. It is designed to ensure that any malfunctions or errors in the vehicle\u2019s systems don\u2019t result in accidents or injuries to passengers or other road users.\n\nThe standard is divided into ten parts, each focusing on different aspects of functional safety, like management of functional safety, concept phase, product development at the system level, hardware development, software development, production and operation, supporting processes, and the relationship with other standards.\n\nISO 25252 has four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL), from A., which is the lowest, to D, which is the highest. Each level corresponds with a different level of risk associated with a potential malfunction or error in the system that could happen. The ASIL is assigned based on a few factors: the severity of the potential hazard; the likelihood of it happening; and if the driver to mitigate the hazard.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Introduction to ISO 24089: Your Ultimate Guide to Understanding and Implementing This New Standard for Automotive](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/introduction-to-iso-24089-your-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-and-implementing)\n\n### Updates to ISO 26262?\n\nSince the original ISO 26262 standard came out in 2011, there\u2019s been several updates and additions to the standard. These updates have been made in order to address new technologies and challenges in the automotive industry.\n\nOne of the most significant updates to the standard came in 2018, with the publication of ISO 26262-11. This addition provides guidelines for the development of safety-critical systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.

The standard provides a framework for developing, testing, and validating the safety of E/E systems in vehicles. It is designed to ensure that any malfunctions or errors in the vehicle\u2019s systems don\u2019t result in accidents or injuries to passengers or other road users.\n\nThe standard is divided into ten parts, each focusing on different aspects of functional safety, like management of functional safety, concept phase, product development at the system level, hardware development, software development, production and operation, supporting processes, and the relationship with other standards.\n\nISO 25252 has four Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL), from A., which is the lowest, to D, which is the highest. Each level corresponds with a different level of risk associated with a potential malfunction or error in the system that could happen. The ASIL is assigned based on a few factors: the severity of the potential hazard; the likelihood of it happening; and if the driver to mitigate the hazard.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Introduction to ISO 24089: Your Ultimate Guide to Understanding and Implementing This New Standard for Automotive](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/introduction-to-iso-24089-your-ultimate-guide-to-understanding-and-implementing)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Updates to ISO 26262?", "level": 3, "content": "Since the original ISO 26262 standard came out in 2011, there\u2019s been several updates and additions to the standard.

From the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles to self-driving cars, automobiles have advanced rapidly from the days of mechanical systems. These advancements are exciting and welcome for a variety of reasons, but they bring along ever-increasing challenges and considerations for developers of everything from windshield wipers to microchips to built-in cameras. As drivers grow increasingly dependent on systems that make getting from point A to point B easier and more fun, they also need to have the assurance that those systems are safe and reliable.\n\nIn this new automotive reality, adhering to safety guidelines has never been more important. As developers and manufacturers work to achieve compliance with ISO 26262, they must understand Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or ASIL, to know what level of rigor to apply.\n\n### What is ASIL?\n\nASIL stands for Automotive Safety Integrity Level, and it is a risk classification system for functional safety of road vehicles. ASIL is defined by the [ISO 26262 standard](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/meeting-regulatory-compliance-and-industry-standards/understanding-iso-standards), part nine, and is adapted from the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) guidance published in IEC 61508.\n\nWhile compliance with ISO 26262 is not mandatory, it is the state-of-the-art practice within the industry, and ASIL is a key piece of the standard. ASIL determines how rigorous the process for developing a product should be based on the risk of that product harming a person if it fails. By doing a full safety assessment of each component, module, or system based on a variety of factors, teams can come to a reasonable expectation of risks and outcomes in the event of failure and implement mitigation efforts to reduce risks.\n\nASIL is determined after a full hazard analysis and risk assessment, or HARA. Engineers or developers assess each component or system with an eye toward risks and hazards presented by the potential failure of that component or system. How likely is the system to fail? What will happen if it fails? Can a driver compensate or manage the failure without injury? Is injury likely to occur in the event of failure, and if so, how severe will the injury be? Once the hazard analysis and risk assessment are complete, teams can assign the ASIL.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [IEC 61508 Overview: The Complete Guide for Functional Safety in Industrial Manufacturing](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/iec-61508-complete-guide-to-functional-safety-in-industrial-manufacturing)\n\n### What are the different ASILs?\n\nASIL classifies hazards in one of four levels, denoted as A through D, with a fifth additional level for non-hazardous systems or components. [ASIL D](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-tool-for-asil-d-requirement-management-iso-26262-iec-61508/) represents the highest level of risk, while ASIL A represents the lowest risk level. The additional level, QM, stands for Quality Management and denotes non-hazardous items that require only standard quality management compliance.\n\nIn general, systems such as anti-lock brakes or airbags require an ASIL D classification because the risks associated with failure are the highest in those systems. At the other end of the spectrum, a system such as rear lights would only require an ASIL A classification; while there is certainly a safety component associated with rear lights, most drivers could mitigate those risks, and the potential severity of injury is typically not high.\n\n### What factors determine an ASIL?\n\nTo determine an ASIL, developers and engineers consider three factors:\n\n- **Severity** (potential severity of injuries caused by a hazardous event)\n- **Exposure** (frequency of conditions that would potentially cause injury)\n- **Controllability** (likelihood that the driver could act to prevent injury)\n\nWithin each of the three factors are additional levels as expressed numerically:\n\n**Severity**\n\nS0: No injuries\n\nS1: Light to moderate injuries\n\nS2: Severe to life-threatening injuries (survival probable)\n\nS3: Life-threatening (survival uncertain) to fatal injuries\n\n**Exposure**\n\nE0: Incredibly unlikely\n\nE1: Very low probability\n\nE2: Low probability\n\nE3: Medium probability\n\nE4: High probability (injury could happen under most operating conditions)\n\n**Controllability**\n\nC0: Controllable generally\n\nC1: Simply controllable\n\nC2: Normally controllable (most drivers could act to prevent injury)\n\nC3: Difficult to control or uncontrollable\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Impact of ISO 26262 on Automotive Development](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/automotive/the-impact-of-iso-26262-on-automotive-development)\n\n### How do I choose my ASIL?\n\nTo determine the ASIL, development teams should put each system, module, or component through a full hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA). The purpose of this assessment is to identify all of the malfunctions that could lead to hazards or failures and evaluate the risks associated with those failures. Any manufacturer who is aiming for ISO 26262 compliance on any product should conduct a HARA and assign an ASIL .\n\nDuring the HARA, teams assign the levels of severity, exposure, and controllability as established by the chart above. Once these levels are established within those categories, teams can use the chart below to arrive at the ASIL :\n\nPLEASE NOTE: While this guide may help you generally identify your ASIL, it should not serve as an official ASIL determination.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.01.46-AM.png)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Here are a few examples:\n\nASIL D: Airbags, antilock braking, electric power steering\n\nASIL C: Adaptive cruise control, battery management, suspension\n\nASIL B: Brake lights, rear view camera, instrument cluster\n\nASIL A: Rear lights, heating and cooling, body control units\n\nQM: GPS/Navigation systems, satellite/digital radio, connectivity (USB, HDMI, Bluetooth)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.02.00-AM.png)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.03.10-AM.png)\n\nEven within these examples, there may be variance between different models, manufacturers, or risk assessments. For example, depending on other factors, \u201cEngine management\u201d risks could be ASIL C or D, and various powertrain systems and risks could vary between ASIL B and ASIL D. A host of considerations go into assessing risk and assigning levels.\n\nIn addition, it is possible for ASIL to change. For example, an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) may determine that a component has a level of ASIL B, but once the component is integrated with other systems, the level may be raised or lowered in conjunction with an additional hazard analysis and risk assessment.\n\n### What are the challenges of ASIL?\n\nAlthough the chart above shows how to arrive at an ASIL based on the severity, exposure, and controllability levels, there is some amount of subjectivity involved in assigning those levels. For example, road conditions, environmental factors, traffic density, driver competence, and likelihood of exposure can all vary widely. A driver who is operating a vehicle on a wide, empty, dry road may be more likely to control for a hazardous event than a driver operating in heavy traffic during a rainstorm. The ASIL classification system depends on subjective interpretation with words such as \u201cusually,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d and \u201cprobably,\u201d which involves some level of educated judgment on the part of engineers and developers. Another challenge with determining ASIL levels is the temptation to make an assumption based on past level assignments without doing a full hazard analysis and risk assessment. For example, if a system was previously assigned ASIL level B, it might be tempting to assume its current level should be the same. However, improvements in the system or integrations with other systems could change the level. If a GPS system now integrates with camera equipment or some other intelligent technology, that new integration could raise or lower the ASIL level.\n\nFinally, teams that are not keeping good documentation records or tracking requirements properly may arrive at inaccurate ASILs \u2014 or even neglect risks entirely. When documentation and requirements aren\u2019t thoroughly tracked, teams may miss key functional safety risks. Requirements tracking and traceability is essential not only for compliance with ISO 26262, but also for the practical market need to thoroughly and accurately assess and mitigate risks.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices to Accelerate Your Automotive Spice (ASPICE) Capabilities](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/automotive/best-practices-to-accelerate-your-automotive-spice-aspice-capabilities)\n\n### How does ASIL impact product development?\n\nOnce the ASIL for a system has been developed, ISO 26262 defined different levels of rigor that are required based on the ASIL. For example, for ASIL A and B, an information notation is sufficient for capturing requirements. This typically means that requirements are written in natural language and augmented with simple figures to illiterate key concepts. For ASIL C and D, a more semi-formal notation is recommended. Requirements are still often written in natural language, but then models of the system are developed to more accurately describe behavior. Developing these models requires additional expertise on the team but increases the accuracy of the documentation and decreases the risk of miscommunication. Teams developing higher ASIL system often require additional expertise as well as specialized software tools to support the process.\n\n### How are ASILs evolving?\n\nThe Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE) issued J2980 in 2015 to provide additional guidance for assessing severity, exposure, and controllability. In addition, J2980 itself was updated in 2018, as was ISO 26262.\n\nAs automotive technology advances with AI (Artificial Intelligence), self-driving features, and integration to external systems through IoT (internet of things), the concept of controllability presents particular challenges. Currently, \u201ccontrollability\u201d largely refers to the human vehicle operator, but as autos become more able to react independently, the standards for assessing controllability may change. With features that compensate more and more for driver error, cars are becoming safer and more intelligent, decreasing the likelihood of hazards that cause severe injury or death. At the same time, however, access to external systems can introduce cyber vulnerabilities that complicate ASIL considerations.\n\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities can lead to safety considerations just like hardware failures.

From the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles to self-driving cars, automobiles have advanced rapidly from the days of mechanical systems. These advancements are exciting and welcome for a variety of reasons, but they bring along ever-increasing challenges and considerations for developers of everything from windshield wipers to microchips to built-in cameras. As drivers grow increasingly dependent on systems that make getting from point A to point B easier and more fun, they also need to have the assurance that those systems are safe and reliable.\n\nIn this new automotive reality, adhering to safety guidelines has never been more important. As developers and manufacturers work to achieve compliance with ISO 26262, they must understand Automotive Safety Integrity Levels, or ASIL, to know what level of rigor to apply.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What is ASIL?", "level": 3, "content": "ASIL stands for Automotive Safety Integrity Level, and it is a risk classification system for functional safety of road vehicles. ASIL is defined by the [ISO 26262 standard](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/meeting-regulatory-compliance-and-industry-standards/understanding-iso-standards), part nine, and is adapted from the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) guidance published in IEC 61508.\n\nWhile compliance with ISO 26262 is not mandatory, it is the state-of-the-art practice within the industry, and ASIL is a key piece of the standard. ASIL determines how rigorous the process for developing a product should be based on the risk of that product harming a person if it fails. By doing a full safety assessment of each component, module, or system based on a variety of factors, teams can come to a reasonable expectation of risks and outcomes in the event of failure and implement mitigation efforts to reduce risks.\n\nASIL is determined after a full hazard analysis and risk assessment, or HARA. Engineers or developers assess each component or system with an eye toward risks and hazards presented by the potential failure of that component or system. How likely is the system to fail? What will happen if it fails? Can a driver compensate or manage the failure without injury? Is injury likely to occur in the event of failure, and if so, how severe will the injury be? Once the hazard analysis and risk assessment are complete, teams can assign the ASIL.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [IEC 61508 Overview: The Complete Guide for Functional Safety in Industrial Manufacturing](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/iec-61508-complete-guide-to-functional-safety-in-industrial-manufacturing)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What are the different ASILs?", "level": 3, "content": "ASIL classifies hazards in one of four levels, denoted as A through D, with a fifth additional level for non-hazardous systems or components. [ASIL D](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/how-to-choose-the-right-tool-for-asil-d-requirement-management-iso-26262-iec-61508/) represents the highest level of risk, while ASIL A represents the lowest risk level. The additional level, QM, stands for Quality Management and denotes non-hazardous items that require only standard quality management compliance.\n\nIn general, systems such as anti-lock brakes or airbags require an ASIL D classification because the risks associated with failure are the highest in those systems. At the other end of the spectrum, a system such as rear lights would only require an ASIL A classification; while there is certainly a safety component associated with rear lights, most drivers could mitigate those risks, and the potential severity of injury is typically not high.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What factors determine an ASIL?", "level": 3, "content": "To determine an ASIL, developers and engineers consider three factors:\n\nWithin each of the three factors are additional levels as expressed numerically:\n\n**Severity**\n\nS0: No injuries\n\nS1: Light to moderate injuries\n\nS2: Severe to life-threatening injuries (survival probable)\n\nS3: Life-threatening (survival uncertain) to fatal injuries\n\n**Exposure**\n\nE0: Incredibly unlikely\n\nE1: Very low probability\n\nE2: Low probability\n\nE3: Medium probability\n\nE4: High probability (injury could happen under most operating conditions)\n\n**Controllability**\n\nC0: Controllable generally\n\nC1: Simply controllable\n\nC2: Normally controllable (most drivers could act to prevent injury)\n\nC3: Difficult to control or uncontrollable\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Impact of ISO 26262 on Automotive Development](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/automotive/the-impact-of-iso-26262-on-automotive-development)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How do I choose my ASIL?", "level": 3, "content": "To determine the ASIL, development teams should put each system, module, or component through a full hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA). The purpose of this assessment is to identify all of the malfunctions that could lead to hazards or failures and evaluate the risks associated with those failures. Any manufacturer who is aiming for ISO 26262 compliance on any product should conduct a HARA and assign an ASIL .\n\nDuring the HARA, teams assign the levels of severity, exposure, and controllability as established by the chart above. Once these levels are established within those categories, teams can use the chart below to arrive at the ASIL :\n\nPLEASE NOTE: While this guide may help you generally identify your ASIL, it should not serve as an official ASIL determination.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.01.46-AM.png)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Ready to Find Out More?", "level": 3, "content": "Our team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Here are a few examples:\n\nASIL D: Airbags, antilock braking, electric power steering\n\nASIL C: Adaptive cruise control, battery management, suspension\n\nASIL B: Brake lights, rear view camera, instrument cluster\n\nASIL A: Rear lights, heating and cooling, body control units\n\nQM: GPS/Navigation systems, satellite/digital radio, connectivity (USB, HDMI, Bluetooth)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.02.00-AM.png)\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2022/06/Screen-Shot-2022-06-23-at-11.03.10-AM.png)\n\nEven within these examples, there may be variance between different models, manufacturers, or risk assessments. For example, depending on other factors, \u201cEngine management\u201d risks could be ASIL C or D, and various powertrain systems and risks could vary between ASIL B and ASIL D. A host of considerations go into assessing risk and assigning levels.\n\nIn addition, it is possible for ASIL to change. For example, an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) may determine that a component has a level of ASIL B, but once the component is integrated with other systems, the level may be raised or lowered in conjunction with an additional hazard analysis and risk assessment.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "What are the challenges of ASIL?", "level": 3, "content": "Although the chart above shows how to arrive at an ASIL based on the severity, exposure, and controllability levels, there is some amount of subjectivity involved in assigning those levels. For example, road conditions, environmental factors, traffic density, driver competence, and likelihood of exposure can all vary widely. A driver who is operating a vehicle on a wide, empty, dry road may be more likely to control for a hazardous event than a driver operating in heavy traffic during a rainstorm. The ASIL classification system depends on subjective interpretation with words such as \u201cusually,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d and \u201cprobably,\u201d which involves some level of educated judgment on the part of engineers and developers. Another challenge with determining ASIL levels is the temptation to make an assumption based on past level assignments without doing a full hazard analysis and risk assessment. For example, if a system was previously assigned ASIL level B, it might be tempting to assume its current level should be the same. However, improvements in the system or integrations with other systems could change the level. If a GPS system now integrates with camera equipment or some other intelligent technology, that new integration could raise or lower the ASIL level.\n\nFinally, teams that are not keeping good documentation records or tracking requirements properly may arrive at inaccurate ASILs \u2014 or even neglect risks entirely. When documentation and requirements aren\u2019t thoroughly tracked, teams may miss key functional safety risks. Requirements tracking and traceability is essential not only for compliance with ISO 26262, but also for the practical market need to thoroughly and accurately assess and mitigate risks.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Best Practices to Accelerate Your Automotive Spice (ASPICE) Capabilities](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/automotive/best-practices-to-accelerate-your-automotive-spice-aspice-capabilities)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How does ASIL impact product development?", "level": 3, "content": "Once the ASIL for a system has been developed, ISO 26262 defined different levels of rigor that are required based on the ASIL. For example, for ASIL A and B, an information notation is sufficient for capturing requirements. This typically means that requirements are written in natural language and augmented with simple figures to illiterate key concepts. For ASIL C and D, a more semi-formal notation is recommended. Requirements are still often written in natural language, but then models of the system are developed to more accurately describe behavior. Developing these models requires additional expertise on the team but increases the accuracy of the documentation and decreases the risk of miscommunication. Teams developing higher ASIL system often require additional expertise as well as specialized software tools to support the process.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "How are ASILs evolving?", "level": 3, "content": "The Society for Automotive Engineers (SAE) issued J2980 in 2015 to provide additional guidance for assessing severity, exposure, and controllability. In addition, J2980 itself was updated in 2018, as was ISO 26262.\n\nAs automotive technology advances with AI (Artificial Intelligence), self-driving features, and integration to external systems through IoT (internet of things), the concept of controllability presents particular challenges. Currently, \u201ccontrollability\u201d largely refers to the human vehicle operator, but as autos become more able to react independently, the standards for assessing controllability may change. With features that compensate more and more for driver error, cars are becoming safer and more intelligent, decreasing the likelihood of hazards that cause severe injury or death. At the same time, however, access to external systems can introduce cyber vulnerabilities that complicate ASIL considerations.\n\nCybersecurity vulnerabilities can lead to safety considerations just like hardware failures.

It entails evaluating the device\u2019s possible benefits as well as drawbacks and deciding if the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. This examination aids in ensuring that medical devices are reliable, safe, and capable of being used by patients without harm.\n\nThe global standard for [risk management of medical devices](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management/understanding-integrated-risk-management-for-medical-devices) is ISO 14971. It offers a framework for recognizing, assessing, and managing hazards related to medical devices. Manufacturers must follow the standard and conduct a benefit-risk analysis as part of the risk management procedure. To ensure that the level of risk connected with a medical device are acceptable and that the benefits outweigh the risks, this analysis is crucial.\n\nTo start a benefit-risk analysis, it is important to first determine the device\u2019s intended use(s). The device\u2019s intended use should be defined in detail and contain information on the patient group it is meant for, the medical problem it is intended to support, and the clinical environment in which it will be used.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Validation Kit for Medical Device & Life Sciences](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/validation-kit-for-medical-device-and-life-sciences)\n\n### Evaluating Medical Device Safety and Efficacy\n\nFinding the potential advantages of the device is the next step after defining its intended usage. Benefits could include better health outcomes, more comfortable patients, and lower healthcare expenses. These advantages should be measured and contrasted with any possible risks connected to using the technology.\n\nA medical device\u2019s dangers may include physical harm to the patient, adverse events, and device failure, according to the definition of [harm within](https://www.jamasoftware.com/requirements-management-guide/meeting-regulatory-compliance-and-industry-standards/understanding-iso-standards) ISO 14971. The possibility and seriousness of each risk should be evaluated, and these risks should be identified and quantified.\n\nEven after risks have been lowered as far as possible with risk controls, there may still be some unacceptable level of risks. This is why a benefit-risk analysis is so important in medical device development.\n\nThe following stage is to assess the benefit-risk balance after the potential advantages and risks have been determined. This entails weighing the device\u2019s possible advantages and disadvantages to decide whether the benefits outweigh the risks.\n\nIf the benefits outweigh the risks, the device may be considered safe and effective for use in the intended patient population. However, if the risks outweigh the benefits, the device may not be considered safe or effective and may need to be redesigned or modified to reduce the risks, a medical device manufacturer might also make the decision not to launch the product to market.\n\nBenefit-risk analysis must be optimized to guarantee the safety and efficacy of medical devices.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Elevating Your Medical Device and Life Sciences Product Development Processes with Jama Connect\u00ae](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/elevating-your-medical-device-and-life-sciences-product-development-processes-with-jama-connect)\n\n### The Ongoing Role Benefit-Risk Analysis and Compliance with Regulatory Standards\n\nThe benefit-risk analysis should be an ongoing process throughout the development and life cycle of the device. As new information becomes available, the analysis should be updated to ensure that the benefits still outweigh the risks, as prescribed in various regulations and [standards such as 14971:2019](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/understanding-integrated-risk-management-for-medical-devices), and [EU MDR/IVDR](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-new-eu-in-vitro-diagnostic-regulation-whats-changing-and-what-you-need-to-know-part-2).\n\nRegulatory standards for medical devices should also be considered in the benefit-risk analysis. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which oversees medical device regulation in the US, requires manufacturers to prove their devices are safe and effective before they can be marketed or sold.\n\nThe FDA requires med device manufacturers to perform a benefit-risk analysis as part of the product development process. This analysis is used to determine whether the benefits of the device outweigh the risks and whether the device is safe and effective for use in the intended patient population.\n\nConducting a benefit-risk analysis is a critical step in the development of med devices. It involves identifying and evaluating potential benefits and risks and determining whether the benefits outweigh the risks. ISO 14971 provides a framework for performing a benefit-risk analysis as part of the risk management process.\n\nOptimizing benefit-risk analysis is important for ensuring that medical devices are safe and effective, meet regulatory requirements, and are reimbursed by healthcare payers.

Streamlining the design and approval process is vital to getting products to market in a timely manner. Proper documentation is key to a smooth approval process.\n\nOne essential ingredient to medical device documentation is the Design History File, or DHF. While a bad DHF may not result in non-compliance, a good DHF can make the difference between a smooth compliance process and a bumpy one. To create a good DHF that streamlines compliance, design teams should know what to include\u2014and what to avoid\u2014as they go through the entire design and approval process.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Avoid the Most Common Challenges of the Design History File](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/avoid-the-most-common-challenges-of-the-design-history-file/)\n\n### In This Webinar, We Discuss the Common Pitfalls of the DHF and How to Avoid Them\n\n### What\u2019s a Design History File, and How are They Used by Product Teams Working on Medical Devices?\n\nBefore reviewing all of the essential DHF ingredients, it can help to back up and establish what it is and why it\u2019s important.\n\nThe Design History File is a collection of documents that describe the design and development activities of a medical device. Its purpose is to demonstrate that the device was developed using the design control process needed to meet FDA requirements.\n\n![Design Control Process](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2021/10/DHF-Diagram.jpg)\n\nFigure 1: Design Control Process for Meeting FDA Requirements\n\nThe DHF requirement was established as part of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990. The act describes the DHF in section\u00a0[21 CFR 820.30](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=820.30), sub-section (j) as follows:\n\n\u201cEach manufacturer shall establish and maintain a DHF for each type of medical device. The DHF shall contain or reference the records necessary to demonstrate that the design was developed in accordance with the approved design plan and the regulations of this part.\u201d\n\nThere are two key terms in the DHF requirement: \u201cestablish\u201d and \u201cmaintain.\u201d \u201cEstablish\u201d means that the development team must define, document, and implement requirements. Evidence is found in procedures, work instructions, drawings, and other similar documents. \u201cMaintain\u201d means that the team must review, approve, and update requirements. Evidence of maintenance is typically found in document control or change control systems of a company.\n\nWhile a comprehensive DHF is vital to the FDA approval process, design teams will realize other benefits of maintaining the DHF, including:\n\n- [Requirements traceability](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-rise-of-connected-medical-devices-and-the-importance-of-requirements-traceability/);\n- Change control; and\n- Knowledge preservation and information sharing among key stakeholders.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Understanding FDA Medical Device Class and Classifications, and its Impact on Requirements Management](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/understanding-fda-medical-device-class-and-classifications-and-its-impact-on-requirements-management?_gl=1*501or*_ga*MTg5MTMzOTc3Ny4xNjU2MzYxMTUz*_ga_JQG3M83PDQ*MTY1NzgyODY1My4zMS4xLjE2NTc4MjkyOTIuMA..)\n\n### What is the difference between DHF and DMR?\n\nThe DHF is one of three pillars of design compliance for medical devices:\n\n1. **Design controls:**\u00a0The moving parts of product design and development.\n2. **Design History File (DHF):\u00a0**The collection of records from design and development activities.\n3. **Device Master Record:**\u00a0The \u201crecipe\u201d for product manufacturing once the design is complete.\n\nAs one of the pillars of design compliance, the DHF is important, but it cannot hold up the design process on its own. It\u2019s one leg of a tripod, and removing any one of the legs means that the entire design compliance process may tip over. Equally important to the process are design controls and the Device Master Record, or DMR.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Requirement Debt\u2122: A Medical Product Program Risk](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/requirement-debt-a-medical-product-program-risk)\n\n### What are design controls, and how does the DHF establish the design control process?\n\nDesign controls establish a plan to manage new product development; they are the process pieces that guide development along a predictable path to ensure that requirements are met. The Safe Medical Devices Act requires that manufacturers of Class II and Class III medical devices (and some Class I devices as well) implement design controls over the development process.\n\nDesign controls include:\n\n- **Design inputs:**\u00a0The physical and performance requirements for the type of device. May also include types of materials needed, interfaces with other devices, and even packaging required, especially if the device must be sterilized.\n- **Design outputs:**\u00a0Usually the final specifications for the device, typically documented in models, drawings, engineering analysis, etc. Outputs should trace directly back to initial requirements. Design outputs are the basis of the Design Medical Record (DMR).\n- **Design review:**\u00a0A formal review by the design team and any other relevant parties, such as sales, marketing, manufacturing, etc. Documentation of the review should include the date, participants, version/revision reviewed, and results.\n- **Design verification:**\u00a0This process verifies that the design output meets the requirements expressed by the design inputs and that specifications are correct. Documentation of this process must include the date, participants, version/revision reviewed, and the verification method and results.\n- **Process validation:\u00a0**Process validation involves producing the device with a normal, low-level production process to confirm that the device will function as designed outside of the prototype process. Documentation of the process is required for the DHF.\n- **Design validation:**\u00a0In this process, each manufacturer validates device design under specific conditions on small production lots or batches. The DHF documentation must include identification of the design, methods of production, date, and individuals performing the validation.\n- **Design transfer:**\u00a0The process of transferring design into production, distribution, and installation specifications.\n- **Design changes:**\u00a0May be referred to as \u201cengineering change\u201d or \u201centerprise change,\u201d this process identifies and documents any design changes.\n- **Design history file:**\u00a0This is the formal document prepared for each medical device that includes either all documents generated in product development process OR an index of documents and locations where they are stored.\n\nAs you can see, the design history file (DHF) is one of many design controls, but it also serves as the repository of records of all other design controls. Think of it as the final stop for the information generated by all other design controls.\n\n### What is in a Device Medical Record (DMR)?\n\nThe third leg in the tripod supporting your compliance process is the Device Medical Record, or DMR. Think of the DMR as the \u201crecipe\u201d that resulted from the design controls to manufacture the device according to design specifications. It\u2019s more than just a production traveler\u2014it will include device specifications, compositions, drawings, formulations, software specifications, etc., as well as production process specifications, including appropriate equipment, methods, procedures and environments, such as clean rooms, humidity controls, quality assurance procedures, and any specialized equipment needed. The DMR will include everything from beginning to end of the production and shipping process, including any relevant installation instructions.\n\n### What are some pitfalls to avoid when compiling the DHF?\n\nMany companies make costly and time-consuming errors when creating their DHFs, leading to longer-than-necessary audits and failed FDA inspections. Avoid these mistakes, and you\u2019ll minimize lost time and unnecessary costs getting to market.\n\nJama Software hosted a webinar led by Quality Centric Consulting to review:\n\n- The top DHF errors that are costing you money\n- How to tackle 21 CFR 820.30 requirements\n- How Jama Connect\u2122 streamlines the DHF process\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Why Your Medical Device Risk Management is NOT Effective](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/blog/why-your-medical-device-risk-management-is-not-effective)\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn About Integrated Risk Management for Medical Devices\n\nFive of the most common pitfalls of the Design History File (DHF) include:\n\n**Not having a DHF:** Usually, small companies strapped for resources will put all their efforts into designing and getting a product to market, with the intention of doing the DHF later on. This could be due to a lack of understanding of what DHF outputs are required.\n\n**Chaotic and unorganized DHF**: This is more typical in paper-based companies that keep all information in binders, but leave off dates or include unapproved documents, making it impossible to organize at the time of an audit or inspection. Disorganization \u2014 whether paper- or email-based \u2014 also makes it difficult to manage changes and revisions due to information silos and lack of sharing information.\n\n**Including unnecessary documents:**\u00a0Adding business documents, such as supplier quotes, financial information or unused concepts, can bring a flurry of unwanted questions from inspectors. This can also be a symptom of not having a DHF tool or template, as well as a linear process that involves lengthy review and approval times.\n\n**Unmaintained DHF:**\u00a0Often companies use either outdated or improper technology for the job. Paper-based systems, email, shared folders with read-write access and the like, are not always effective document controls. This can lead to lost copies of important records, making a DHF non-compliant.\n\n**Not traceable to outputs:\u00a0**Without a DHF, it\u2019s impossible to create your DMR, and very difficult to\u00a0[establish your traceability matrix](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-be-developing-medical-devices-without-traceability/). If design control results are not well documented, easy to locate or current, your DMR will fail to be compliant.\n\nCreating the DHF may feel like a heavy burden, but it is the key to a smooth compliance process. By treating the Design History File (DHF) as part of your design and development process from the beginning, these requirements become seamless and help ease the path to compliance.\n\nJama Connect can help traceability and requirements management and encourage\u00a0[a systems approach to medical device development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/why-systems-thinking-improves-medical-device-development/), making the creation of a DHF more seamless and streamlined than ever before.

This could be due to a lack of understanding of what DHF outputs are required.\n\n**Chaotic and unorganized DHF**: This is more typical in paper-based companies that keep all information in binders, but leave off dates or include unapproved documents, making it impossible to organize at the time of an audit or inspection. Disorganization \u2014 whether paper- or email-based \u2014 also makes it difficult to manage changes and revisions due to information silos and lack of sharing information.\n\n**Including unnecessary documents:**\u00a0Adding business documents, such as supplier quotes, financial information or unused concepts, can bring a flurry of unwanted questions from inspectors. This can also be a symptom of not having a DHF tool or template, as well as a linear process that involves lengthy review and approval times.\n\n**Unmaintained DHF:**\u00a0Often companies use either outdated or improper technology for the job. Paper-based systems, email, shared folders with read-write access and the like, are not always effective document controls. This can lead to lost copies of important records, making a DHF non-compliant.\n\n**Not traceable to outputs:\u00a0**Without a DHF, it\u2019s impossible to create your DMR, and very difficult to\u00a0[establish your traceability matrix](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/why-you-shouldnt-be-developing-medical-devices-without-traceability/). If design control results are not well documented, easy to locate or current, your DMR will fail to be compliant.\n\nCreating the DHF may feel like a heavy burden, but it is the key to a smooth compliance process. By treating the Design History File (DHF) as part of your design and development process from the beginning, these requirements become seamless and help ease the path to compliance.\n\nJama Connect can help traceability and requirements management and encourage\u00a0[a systems approach to medical device development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/why-systems-thinking-improves-medical-device-development/), making the creation of a DHF more seamless and streamlined than ever before.

Your Comprehensive Guide to Compliant Medical Device Manufacturing\n\nIn this subchapter, we will cover key components of the important medical device standard ISO 13485 and cover steps for successful adherence.\n\nIn the complex world of medical device development, teams not only face challenges of innovation, but also a shifting regulatory environment and evolving standards.\n\nBalancing the competing interests of customers and stakeholders with the guidance and regulations from different entities across global boundaries presents challenges that even the most organized and methodical teams may struggle to meet.\n\nIn this environment, systems thinking can greatly improve the ability of medical device development teams to get products from the idea stage to market. By breaking down complex problems into manageable pieces, teams can better evaluate their systems and streamline and strengthen processes.\n\nUsing an applied systems approach will also help resolve inefficiencies in the development process and produce the outputs necessary for the design history file (DHF).\n\nA growing number of organizations and teams are already pursuing a general systems approach by applying the guidance in ISO 13485:2016. This standard helps define a framework for the Quality Management System (QMS) for medical device development and pushes the development process naturally toward a systems approach. But for those teams that have not yet adopted the standard, adding one more document or piece of guidance to the overall process can feel like another layer of complication.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be. Adopting this standard can help standardize and systematize the medical device development process. Though it may look daunting at first, once adopted, ISO 13485 can streamline processes and position organizations for a better outcome with regulatory requirements.\n\n### The Purpose of ISO 13485\n\nThe standard was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to outline the standard for a Quality Management System (QMS) for the design and manufacture of medical devices.\n\nThe ISO defines \u201cmedical device\u201d as \u201ca product, such as an instrument, machine, implant or in vitro reagent, that is intended for use in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases or other medical conditions.\u201d It is a stand-alone document designed for use by organizations of any size involved in any stage of medical device development, from design to production to installation to service of devices. Both internal and external parties can use the standard to support the auditing process.\n\nISO 13485 is the most common standard for quality management in the field of medical device development across the globe. Adoption of the standard indicates a commitment to the highest quality and safety across the development process, and it provides a foundation for QMS requirements.\n\nWhile not required by all government entities, the standard does provide a good foundation for addressing regulations such as the EU Medical Device Directive and the EU Medical Device Regulation. In 2018, the FDA proposed a rule that would align US FDA 21 CFR 820 with ISO 13485:2016; this rule would make this standard the mandatory QMS for medical devices.\n\nNote: The rule was set for release in 2019; however, as of December 2020, the rule was still forthcoming. Check for current guidance.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Understanding Integrated Risk Management for Medical Devices](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/understanding-integrated-risk-management-for-medical-devices)\n\n### Requirements for ISO 13485 Adherence\n\nThough adoption of ISO 13485 may look complicated or daunting, in reality, adhering to the standard helps eliminate some of the ad hoc nature of requirements and systems in the medical device field.\n\n**A quality management system:** The QMS needs to include documentation, internal audits, and corrective actions must be established and maintained.\n\n**Risk management system:** Teams must also set up a risk management strategy to identify and evaluate any potential risks related to the medical device during the course of its lifetime.\n\n**Compliance verification:** Organizations must verify that their goods comply with both customer and regulatory criteria, according to ISO 13485. To guarantee that products are identified and traced along the supply chain, this includes maintaining traceability and record-keeping systems.\n\n**System of control:** A system for the control of non-conforming products must also be established and maintained by organizations in order to ensure that any problems are found and resolved quickly and effectively.\n\nWith increasing worldwide adoption of ISO 13485 by both companies and government entities, the medical device industry should start to realize some harmonization and consistency of processes and systems. This standardization will help streamline the industry overall and allow important innovations a smoother and potentially faster route to market.\n\nThe requirements to obtain ISO 13485 certification start with a QMS. [ASQ defines a Quality Management System](https://asq.org/quality-resources/quality-glossary/q) as \u201ca formal system that documents the structure, processes, roles, responsibilities and procedures required to achieve effective quality management.\u201d The QMS must include documentation that defines the overall scope and implementation of the QMS; important documentation includes Quality Policy, Quality Objectives, and Quality Manual.\n\nBottom Line These documents should be sure to address customer requirements. In addition, organizations need to create mandatory and additional processes and requirements necessary for all stages of development. Examples of documents required by ISO 13485:2016 [can be found here](https://advisera.com/13485academy/blog/2017/01/18/list-of-mandatory-documents-required-by-iso-134852016/).\n\n### Management Requirements for ISO 13485 Compliance\n\nManagement responsibility for ISO 13485 compliance involves ensuring that the quality management system is established, implemented, and maintained, assigning responsibilities for specific quality-related tasks, providing adequate resources and training, monitoring the system\u2019s effectiveness, and continually improving it. Top management is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and must actively demonstrate their commitment to quality throughout the organization.\n\n### Design and Development Processes Required\n\nISO 13485 requires a structured design and development process that includes planning, input requirements, output specifications, design verification and validation, and design changes. It emphasizes the importance of risk management throughout the process and requires documentation of all stages of development. The process must also include design transfer to production and post-production activities such as monitoring and review. The goal is to ensure that medical devices are safe, effective, and meet customer and regulatory requirements.\n\n### Product Realization Management\n\nPRM, or product reality management, is essential to ISO 13485 compliance. Designing, creating, and producing medical devices in accordance with patient demands, legal requirements, and consumer expectations is known as PRM.\n\nAccording to ISO 13485, manufacturers of medical devices must have a PRM process that is clearly defined and involves the following stages; planning, design and development, validation, production, monitoring, and measurement. Each of these stages essential for guaranteeing the security, efficiency, and dependability of medical equipment.\n\nCompanies must specify the PRM process\u2019s parameters, pinpoint customer wants, and ascertain regulatory requirements during the planning phase. A thorough design specification must be created, prototypes must be developed, and risk analysis must be done during the design and development process. The device is put through testing during the validation process to make sure it complies with all requirements and specifications.\n\nOnce the device has been validated, it can enter the production phase, where it is manufactured according to the approved design and production processes. Next, the monitoring and measurement phase involves ongoing monitoring of the device\u2019s performance and the implementation of corrective actions if necessary.\n\nISO 13485 emphasizes the importance of document control throughout the PRM process. Medical device companies must maintain detailed records of all design and development activities, testing and validation results, and production processes. This documentation is critical for demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements and for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of medical devices.\n\n### The Difference Between ISO 13485 and Other Medical Device Standards\n\nEN ISO 13485: EN ISO 13485 is simply the European version of ISO 13485; the requirements of both are identical, and all of ISO 13485 is included within EN ISO 13485. The difference between the two standards lies in the inclusion of several tables in EN ISO 13485 that can help teams meet the requirements of three European directives for medical devices (EU directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC, and 98/79/EC). The tables in EN ISO 13485 align the requirements of ISO 13485 with these European directives, allowing teams to see how adoption of the standard will help meet the requirements of the directives.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the European Union Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR), released in 2017, supersedes the previous EU directives. A future release of EN ISO 13485 is expected to show alignment with the EU MDR.\n\nISO 9001: ISO 13485 is based on ISO 9001:2008, which is an internationally recognized standard for QMS in any organization or industry. However, ISO 13485 goes beyond the ISO 9001 standard to address the specific needs of the medical device industry. Additional requirements for the medical device industry include:\n\n- Specific documentation requirements for medical device files\n- Work environment and contamination control requirements\n- Production requirements that address cleanliness of products and assurance of a sterile environment where appropriate\n- Regulatory reporting guidance\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that ISO 13485 aligns with the 2008 version of ISO 9001 \u2014 not the 2015 version. The ISO 9001:2015 includes requirements that were not deemed relevant to the medical device industry, so the ISO 9001:2008 remains the standard most closely aligned with ISO 13485.\n\nISO 14971: ISO 14971 and ISO 13485 are related, but ISO 14971 includes greater detail regarding risk management requirements. The two standards work together to create a QMS that addresses the full spectrum of requirements unique to the medical device industry.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [A Guide to Understanding ISO Standards](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/a-guide-to-understanding-iso-standards/)\n\n### Analysis&Improvement\n\nThe goal is to continually improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the system to meet customer and regulatory requirements and enhance overall product quality. The ISO 13485 quality control system must therefore include measurement, analysis, and improvement. To track the performance of the system and find areas for improvement, this method entails developing metrics and gathering data. Performance is frequently assessed using key performance indicators (KPIs), such as client satisfaction, product quality, and on-time delivery.\n\nData analysis is used to find patterns and trends that can shed light on the underlying causes of quality problems. This entails locating and recording non-conformities, putting necessary corrective and preventative measures in place, and assessing how well they work. The ISO 13485 standard also highlights how crucial risk management is to the process of measurement, analysis, and development.\n\nContinual improvement is a key principle of ISO 13485. Organizations are required to establish a process for identifying and implementing opportunities for improvement, which often includes necessary adjustments to the QMS, design, or manufacturing processes.\n\n### Key Takeaways from Our Complete Guide\n\n- ISO 13485 and systems thinking go hand-in-hand; teams will find that adoption of ISO 13485 directs them toward systems thinking.\n- Adoption of this standard will streamline processes and position medical device teams for better regulatory outcomes.\n- ISO 13485 is a stand-alone document; however, it closely aligns with ISO 9001:2008 and EN ISO 13485.\n- ISO 13485 and ISO 14971 are related, but ISO 14971 is more focused on risk management \u2013 the two standards can be used in tandem.\n- This standard is not mandatory; teams can develop a Quality Management System (QMS) without the standard as long as it meets regulatory requirements. However, adoption of the ISO 13485 will create a QMS that is ideally positioned to meet the requirements of various regulatory and legislative entities, including the EU.\n\nJama Software\u2019s Complete Guide to ISO 13485 for Medical Device Development covers requirements for adherence, the difference between ISO 13485 and other medical device standards, and steps for successful adoption and certification.\n\n#### Download The Complete Guide to ISO 13485 for Medical Device Development to untangle everything there is to know about this important standard.\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/medical-device/complete-guide-to-iso-13485-for-medical-devices?utm_campaign=cta+blog)\n\n[](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/webinar/best-practices-for-requirements-traceability)\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn the Critical Challenges to Reducing Risk in Product Development and More\n\nDEFINITION OF ISO:\n\n**ISO:** International Organization for Standardization\n\nPREVIOUSWhat\u2019s a Design History File, and How Are DHFs Used by Product Teams?\n\nNEXT UPFailure Modes, Effects, and Diagnostic Analysis (FMEDA) for Medical Devices: What You Need to Know\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

The difference between the two standards lies in the inclusion of several tables in EN ISO 13485 that can help teams meet the requirements of three European directives for medical devices (EU directives 90/385/EEC, 93/42/EEC, and 98/79/EC). The tables in EN ISO 13485 align the requirements of ISO 13485 with these European directives, allowing teams to see how adoption of the standard will help meet the requirements of the directives.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that the European Union Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR), released in 2017, supersedes the previous EU directives. A future release of EN ISO 13485 is expected to show alignment with the EU MDR.\n\nISO 9001: ISO 13485 is based on ISO 9001:2008, which is an internationally recognized standard for QMS in any organization or industry. However, ISO 13485 goes beyond the ISO 9001 standard to address the specific needs of the medical device industry. Additional requirements for the medical device industry include:\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that ISO 13485 aligns with the 2008 version of ISO 9001 \u2014 not the 2015 version. The ISO 9001:2015 includes requirements that were not deemed relevant to the medical device industry, so the ISO 9001:2008 remains the standard most closely aligned with ISO 13485.\n\nISO 14971: ISO 14971 and ISO 13485 are related, but ISO 14971 includes greater detail regarding risk management requirements.

It\u2019s intended for use with *AAMI TIR57 Principles for Medical Device Security \u2013 Risk Management*, which addresses cybersecurity analysis, and AAMI TIR97, Principles for Medical Device Security, *which guides processes for managing* medical devices in the post-market space.\n\nThe goal of the new standard is to support manufacturers in ensuring that medical devices are reliable, work as intended, and don\u2019t cause harm to patients, operators, or the environment. It also focuses on mitigating any potential risks around device failure.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Understanding Integrated Risk Management for Medical Devices](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/understanding-integrated-risk-management-for-medical-devices)\n\n### Why is security for medical devices important?\n\nSecurity has always been important to medical device manufacturers, which is why considerations are included in ISO 14971:2019. However, ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023 aims to deepen security-related standards.\n\nAddressing potential security risks throughout the entire product lifecycle, including design, production, and post-production, enables manufacturers to identify and mitigate potential risks through a more focused and proactive approach. It helps manufacturers continually identify, review, and safeguard against fast-evolving threats\n\n### Understanding the security risk management process\n\nAs you get up to speed with ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023, the \u201csecurity risk management process\u201d section includes details for mitigating potential threats. It includes six major sections, everything from security risk analysis to production and post-production activities. Each section contains a detailed framework, but for the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ve highlighted a few main points for each.\n\n### The 6 Sections of Security Risk Management\n\n![This image portrays the 6 steps to understanding security risk management.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2024/03/6-Steps-Risk-Management.png)\n\n1. **Security risk analysis.** It focuses on selecting product security standards, performing threat modeling, and establishing capabilities to identify and detect security vulnerabilities across a medical device\u2019s entire lifecycle.\n2. **Security risk evaluation.** Establishes a security assessment strategy and testing processes.\n3. **Security risk control.** Identifies, designs, and implements security risk control\u00a0measures, as well as verifying the implementation effectiveness of any security risk control measures.\n4. **Evaluation of overall security residual risk acceptability.** Determine if the \u201csecurity residual risk\u201d of a device is acceptable.\n5. **Security risk management review.** A security management report is prepared.\n6. **Production and post-production activities.** Potential vulnerabilities are monitored to identify any new security risks. Also, it establishes processes to stay aware of new threats, creating security incident response plans and other measures to identify ongoing vulnerabilities.\n\n### Section 1: Security Risk Analysis\n\nThe security risk analysis focuses on selecting product security standards, performing threat modeling, and establishing capabilities to identify and detect security vulnerabilities across a medical device\u2019s entire lifecycle. It covers:\n\n1. **Security risk analysis process:** It suggests that manufacturers perform a security risk analysis, and the results are recorded in the \u201csecurity risk management file.\u201d\n2. **Intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse:** The \u201csecurity risk management\u201d file includes reference documents developed in compliance with clause 5.2 of ISO 14971. It needs to account for \u201cthe use of a medical device in a way not intended by the manufacturer, but which can result from readily predictable behavior.\u201d\n3. **Identification of assets and characteristics related to security:** You\u2019ll also identify potential medical device vulnerabilities such as third-party components, hardware, and software.\n4. **Security risk estimation:** You will estimate the associated \u201crisks\u201d for each of the identified security vulnerabilities and potential impacts on areas like confidentiality and integrity.\n\n### Section 2: Security Risk Evaluation\n\nThe security risk evaluation establishes a security assessment strategy and testing processes. A few areas it considers:\n\n1. **Evaluation of each security risk:** Identify each security risk area, determining if a \u201csecurity reduction\u201d is required.\n2. **Evaluation of security risks with a potential safety impact:** Consider every potential risk to determine any potential safety impacts.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Complete Guide to ISO 13485 for Medical Devices](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/complete-guide-to-iso-13485-for-medical-devices)\n\n### Section 3: Security Risk Control\n\nThis section is focused on identifying, designing, and implementing security risk control measures, as well as verifying the implementation effectiveness of any security risk control measures, including:\n\n1. **Security risk control option analysis:** Determine if a security risk control measure is appropriate for mitigating security risks to an \u201cacceptable level.\u201d\n2. **Implementation of security risk control measures:** Security risk measures are selected based on the prior step.\n3. **Security residual risk evaluation:** After the security risk control measures are implemented, the manufacturer evaluates the security residential risk and records this evaluation in the security risk management file.\n4. **Benefit-risk analysis:** If a security residual risk is found to be \u201cacceptable\u201d using the criteria created in the security risk management plan, and further security risk control isn\u2019t practical, the manufacturer conducts benefits versus security risk analysis.\n5. **Risks arising from security risk control measures:** The manufacturer reviews the effects of the security risk control measures to understand whether new security vulnerabilities and threats are introduced that could impact security, safety, or privacy.\n6. **Completeness of security risk controls:** The manufacturer periodically reviews security risk control activities to ensure all vulnerabilities and threats are considered and security risk control activities are complete.\n\n### Section 4: Evaluation of Overall Security Residual Risk Acceptability\n\nAfter the security risk controls are implemented and verified, the manufacturer determines if the overall \u201csecurity residual risk\u201d created by the medical device is acceptable.\n\n### Section 5: Security Risk Management Review\n\nThe standard recommends a review of the execution of the security management plan before releasing a new device. According to ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023, the review should ensure:\n\n1. The security risk management plan has been appropriately implemented.\n2. The \u201csecurity residual risk\u201d is at an acceptable level.\n3. Methods are in place to gather and review details in the production and post-production phases, and leadership has reviewed and approved the plan.\n\n### Section 6: Production and Post-production Activities\n\nThe final section is focused on establishing, documenting, and maintaining a system to monitor, assemble, and review information about medical device security in the production and post-market phases. Also, it establishes processes to stay aware of new threats, creating security incident response plans and other measures to identify ongoing vulnerabilities.\n\n#### To Access This Content In Its Entirety, Download The \u201cWhat You Need to Know: ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023\u201d eBook\n\n[](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/what-you-need-to-know-ansi-aami-sw96-2023-medical-device-security)\n\n### In This Webinar, Learn How to Enhance Security Risk Management with ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023\n\nDEFINITION OF ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023:\n\n**ANSI/AAMI SW96:2023:** is a standard which includes policies, procedures, and best practices designed to evaluate, control, and monitor potential risks involved with a medical device.\n\nPREVIOUSUnderstanding ISO/IEC 27001: A Guide to Information Security Management\n\nNEXT UPThe Fundamentals of Business Requirements: Examples of Business Requirements and the Importance of Excellence\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

This article delves into the differences and synergies between ISO 13485 and ISO 9001, offering insights into their respective applications and benefits.\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2024/06/ISO-13485-vs-ISO-9001-1030x1030.jpg)\n\n### The Purpose of ISO 13485\n\nThe standard was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to outline the standard for a Quality Management System (QMS) for the design and manufacture of medical devices.\n\nThe ISO defines \u201cmedical device\u201d as \u201ca product, such as an instrument, machine, implant or in vitro reagent, that is intended for use in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of diseases or other medical conditions.\u201d It is a stand-alone document designed for use by organizations of any size involved in any stage of medical device development, from design to production to installation to service of devices. Both internal and external parties can use the standard to support the auditing process.\n\nISO 13485 is the most common standard for quality management in the field of medical device development across the globe. Adoption of the standard indicates a commitment to the highest quality and safety across the development process, and it provides a foundation for QMS requirements.\n\nWhile not required by all government entities, the standard does provide a good foundation for addressing regulations such as the EU Medical Device Directive and the EU Medical Device Regulation. In 2018, the FDA proposed a rule that would align US FDA 21 CFR 820 with ISO 13485:2016; this rule would make this standard the mandatory QMS for medical devices.\n\nNote: The rule was set for release in 2019; however, as of December 2020, the rule was still forthcoming. Check for current guidance.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Understanding Integrated Risk Management for Medical Devices](https://resources.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/understanding-integrated-risk-management-for-medical-devices)\n\n### ISO 9001: A Broad-Spectrum Quality Management System\n\n![Image](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2024/06/ISO_9001-2015.svg-1030x942.png)\n\n**Scope and Purpose**\n\nISO 9001 is the most widely recognized quality management system (QMS) standard in the world. It is designed to be applicable to any organization, regardless of its type, size, or the products and services it provides. The primary aim of ISO 9001 is to help organizations consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements and enhance customer satisfaction through effective process management and continuous improvement.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Customer Focus:** Emphasis on understanding and meeting customer needs and expectations.\n- **Leadership:** Promotes active involvement of top management in developing and maintaining the QMS.\n- **Engagement of People:** Encourages the involvement of all employees in quality processes.\n- **Process Approach:** Manages activities as processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness.\n- **Improvement:** Continuously seeks to improve the QMS.\n- **Evidence-Based Decision Making:** Bases decisions on the analysis of data.\n- **Relationship Management:** Manages relationships with interested parties to enhance performance.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae for Medical Device & Life Sciences Development Datasheet](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect-for-medical-device-development-and-life-sciences-datasheet)\n\n### ISO 13485: Tailored for Medical Devices\n\n### \n\n**Scope and Purpose**\n\nISO 13485 is specifically designed for organizations involved in the design, production, installation, and servicing of medical devices and related services. Its primary objective is to facilitate harmonized medical device regulatory requirements and ensure that medical devices are consistently produced to meet customer and regulatory requirements.\n\n**Key Features**\n\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Focuses extensively on meeting regulatory requirements applicable to medical devices.\n- **Risk Management:** Implements a risk management approach throughout the product lifecycle.\n- **Design and Development Controls:** Requires rigorous controls during the design and development of medical devices.\n- **Product Realization:** Emphasizes planning and control of the processes needed for product realization.\n- **Validation of Processes:** Necessitates validation of processes that affect the final product, such as sterilization.\n- **Traceability:** Ensures traceability of products throughout the supply chain.\n- **Post-Market Surveillance:** Includes requirements for post-market monitoring and reporting of adverse events.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n- **Industry Focus:** ISO 9001 is generic and can be applied to any industry, while ISO 13485 is specifically tailored for the medical device industry.\n- **Regulatory Emphasis:** ISO 13485 places a stronger emphasis on regulatory requirements and compliance due to the critical nature of medical devices.\n- **Risk Management:** ISO 13485 incorporates more detailed risk management requirements throughout the product lifecycle.\n- **Documentation:** ISO 13485 generally requires more extensive documentation, including records of design and development activities, validation of processes, and traceability.\n- **Continuous Improvement vs. Risk Management:** ISO 9001 emphasizes continuous improvement as a core principle, while ISO 13485 focuses more on risk management and maintaining the effectiveness of the QMS.\n\n### Synergies and Integration\n\nOrganizations in the medical device industry often integrate ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 to leverage the strengths of both standards. This integration allows them to benefit from the broad quality management principles of ISO 9001 while meeting the stringent regulatory requirements of ISO 13485.\n\n**Benefits of Integration**\n\n- **Comprehensive QMS:** Combines the broad quality principles of ISO 9001 with the specific regulatory focus of ISO 13485.\n- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Streamlines processes and reduces redundancies by aligning common requirements.\n- **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensures comprehensive compliance with both general and industry-specific regulations.\n- **Market Advantage:** Demonstrates a robust commitment to quality and regulatory compliance, enhancing reputation and competitiveness.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [A Guide to Understanding ISO Standards](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/a-guide-to-understanding-iso-standards/)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile ISO 13485 and ISO 9001 serve different purposes and industries, understanding their differences and synergies can help organizations effectively implement and maintain a quality management system that meets both general and specific requirements. For medical device manufacturers, integrating these standards can provide a robust framework for quality and regulatory compliance, ultimately ensuring the safety and efficacy of their products.\n\n*Note: This article was drafted with the aid of AI.

Architects are responsible for creating the aesthetic and functional aspects of a project. They consider various factors such as the purpose of the building, the needs of the occupants, and the environmental impact. The architectural process involves:\n\n- **Conceptual Design:** Creating initial sketches and ideas based on client requirements and site conditions.\n- **Schematic Design:** Developing more detailed plans and visual representations.\n- **Design Development:** Refining the design, selecting materials, and incorporating engineering systems.\n- **Construction Documents:** Producing detailed drawings and specifications for construction.\n\nArchitects work closely with engineers and construction professionals to ensure their designs are feasible and can be constructed safely and efficiently.\n\n### Engineering\n\nEngineering in the AEC industry involves applying scientific principles and technical expertise to ensure that architectural designs are structurally sound and functional. There are several engineering disciplines involved in the AEC industry, including:\n\n- **Structural Engineering:** Ensures that the building can withstand various loads and forces, such as gravity, wind, and earthquakes.\n- **Mechanical Engineering:** Designs heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, as well as plumbing and fire protection.\n- **Electrical Engineering:** Develops electrical systems, including power distribution, lighting, and communication networks.\n- **Civil Engineering:** Focuses on infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges, and water supply systems.\n\nEngineers collaborate with architects and construction teams to integrate their systems into the overall design and ensure that the project meets all safety and regulatory requirements.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/selecting-the-right-requirements-management-and-traceability-solution)\n\n### Construction\n\nConstruction is the process of bringing architectural and engineering designs to life. Construction professionals manage the physical building process, ensuring that the project is completed on time, within budget, and to the required quality standards and specifications. Key aspects of constrction include:\n\n- **Project Management:** Planning, coordinating, and overseeing the entire construction process.\n- **Cost Estimation and Budgeting:** Determining the financial resources required and managing expenses.\n- **Scheduling:** Creating timelines for project milestones and ensuring timely completion.\n- **Quality Control and Assurance:** Ensuring that construction meets design specifications and safety standards.\n\nConstruction teams work on-site to handle the logistics of building, from laying foundations to finishing touches, often coordinating with various subcontractors and suppliers.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe AEC industry is a dynamic and collaborative field that integrates architecture, engineering, and construction to create the built environment. Each component plays a vital role in the success of a project, requiring a high level of coordination and expertise. By understanding the distinct yet interconnected roles within the AEC industry, we can better appreciate the complexity and creativity involved in shaping the spaces we live and work in.\n\nThis post aims to provide a clear overview of the AEC industry, highlighting the key roles and contributions of architecture, engineering, and construction. For those interested in a career in this field or seeking to understand how buildings and infrastructure come to life, the AEC industry offers a fascinating and rewarding pathway.\n\n### In this Video, Learn How To Tighten Control Over Project Costs, Compliance, and Completion with Jama Connect\u00ae\n\nDEFINITION OF AEC:\n\n**AEC** stands for Architecture, Engineering, and Construction.\n\nPREVIOUSArchitecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC industry) Development\n\nNEXT UPKey Traceability Challenges and Tips for Ensuring Accountability and Efficiency\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

The challenge is that oftentimes systems are incredibly complex with many interdependencies, making it difficult to fully identify every potential safety risk.\n\nAccording to the [International Electrotechnical Commission](https://storage-iecwebsite-prd-iec-ch.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2019-09/content/media/files/functional_safety.pdf), leading contributors to failure include:\n\n- Systematic or random failure of hardware or software\n- Human error\n- Environmental interference, such as temperature, weather, and more\n- Loss of electrical supply or other system disturbance\n- Incorrect system specifications in hardware or software\n\nIEC 61508 creates requirements to ensure that systems are designed, implemented, operated, and maintained at the safety level required to mitigate the most dangerous risks. The international standard is used by a wide range of manufacturers, system engineers, designers, and industrial companies, and others that are audited based on compliance. The standard applies to safety-critical products including electrical, electronic, and programmable-related systems.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Top Challenges in Industrial Manufacturing and Consumer Electronic Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-top-challenges-in-industrial-manufacturing-and-consumer-electronic-development)\n\n### Why Was IEC 61508 Developed?\n\nThe primary goal of the standard is human safety, and it\u2019s based on a couple of principles, including:\n\n1: Use of a safety lifecycle. The lifecycle outlines the best practices around identifying risks and mitigating potential design errors.\n\n2: Probable failure exercises. This assumes that if a device does fail, a \u201cfail-safe\u201d plan is needed.\n\nIEC 61508 applies to all industries; however, even though it covers a broad range of sectors, every industry has its own nuances. As a result, many have developed their own standards based on IEC 61508.\n\nIndustry-specific functional safety standards include ones for:\n\n- **Industrial \u2013** IEC 61496-1, IEC 61131-6, ISO 13849, IEC 61800-5-2, ISO 13850, IEC 62061, IEC 62061, ISO 10218\n- **Transportation \u2013** EN 5012x, ISO 26262, ISO 25119, ISO 15998\n- **Buildings \u2013** EN/ 81/ EN 115\n- **Medical devices \u2013** IEC 60601, IEC 62304\n- **Household appliances \u2013** IEC 60335, IEC 60730\n- **Energy systems and providers \u2013** IEC 62109, IEC 61513, IEC 50156, IEC 61511\n\nThe standard includes Safety Integrity Levels (SILs), which cover four stages from SIL 1 to SIL 4 and indicate whether a safety function is likely to result in a dangerous failure.\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

The goal of the standard is to mitigate or reduce failure risk to a specific tolerance level. The standard includes a lifecycle with 16 phases, broken into seven parts, including:\n\n- Part 1: General requirements\n- Part 2: Requirements for electric, electric programmable safety-relevant systems\n- Part 3: Software requirements\n- Part 4: Abbreviations and definitions\n- Part 5: Examples and methods to determine the appropriate safety integrity levels\n- Part 6: Guidelines on how to apply Part 2 and Part 3 Part 7: An overview of techniques and measures\n\nThe first three parts highlight the standard\u2019s requirements, and the rest explain the guidelines and provide examples of development.\n\n###### IEC 61508 Certification: Is it Required?\n\nIEC 61508 certification is optional in most cases, unless you contract with a firm that requires it, or it\u2019s required by your local government. Even if it\u2019s not mandatory, achieving certification provides peace of mind and creates a clear path to improving safety. Certification is offered through international agencies specializing in IEC 61508, such as the [T\u00dcV S\u00dcD](https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us/services/functional-safety/about). Completing certification provides creditability around your IEC 61508 compliance and is a point of differentiation if bidding on a contract against multiple contractors.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae for Robotics Datasheet](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect-for-robotics-datasheet)\n\n### Hazard and Risk Analysis for Determining SIL\n\nUnderstanding functional safety requires a hazard analysis and risk assessment of the equipment under control (EUC).\n\nThe hazard analysis identifies all possible hazards of a product, process, or application. This will determine the functional safety requirements to meet a particular safety standard.\n\nA risk assessment is needed for every hazard that you identify. The risk assessment will evaluate the frequency and likelihood of that hazard occurring, as well as the potential consequences if it does happen.\n\nThe risk assessment determines the appropriate SIL level, and you can then use either qualitative or quantitative analysis to assess the risk. The guidelines don\u2019t require a specific method of analysis, so use whatever method you prefer.\n\nTo learn more, [visit our IEC 61508 eBook.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/iec-61508-complete-guide-to-functional-safety-in-industrial-manufacturing)\n\n### In this Video, Learn About the Top Challenges in ICE\n\nDEFINITION OF IEC 61508:\n\n**IEC 61508** creates requirements to ensure that systems are designed, implemented, operated, and maintained at the safety level required to mitigate the most dangerous risks.\n\nPREVIOUSIndustrial Manufacturing & Machinery, Automation & Robotics, Consumer Electronics, and Energy\n\nNEXT UPT\u00dcV S\u00dcD: Ensuring Safety, Quality, and Sustainability Worldwide\n\n.flex_column.av-m4auxxrv-ed813687835a92784865e29ca937fa69{\nwidth:59.2%;\nborder-radius:8px 8px 8px 8px;\npadding:20px 20px 20px 20px;\nbackground-color:#f8fbff;\nbackground:linear-gradient( to bottom, #f8fbff, #fafbfd );\n}\n\n#top .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba{\npadding-bottom:10px;\ncolor:#000e78;\n}\nbody .av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-special-heading-tag .heading-char{\nfont-size:25px;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .special-heading-inner-border{\nborder-color:#000e78;\n}\n.av-special-heading.av-m4auzxjq-528a2e5d99e650173b0fd30a4c0c4bba .av-subheading{\nfont-size:15px;\n}\n\n### Book a Demo\n\n#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm {width:100% !important;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow {width:100%;display:block;}#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2) { width: 49% !important; margin: 0 1% 0 0; width: 49% !important;}@media (max-width: 480px) {#top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+1), #top .column-form.white-bkg #mktoForm_3182.mktoForm .mktoFormRow .mktoFormRow .mktoFormCol:nth-of-type(n+2){width:100% !important;}}\n\nMktoForms2.loadForm(\"//go.jamasoftware.com\", \"078-EIF-407\", 3182);\nMktoForms2.whenReady(function (form){\nvar redirectTimeMs = 4000;  \n/*Add an onSuccess handler*/ \nform.onSuccess(function(values, followUpUrl){\nvar thankYouURL = followUpUrl+  \"?FirstName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.FirstName) +  \"&LastName=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.LastName)+  \"&Email=\" + encodeURIComponent(values.Email);console.log(thankYouURL);\ndocument.location.href = thankYouURL;\nreturn false;\n});\n});\n\nclose flex column wrapper.

The standard applies to safety-critical products including electrical, electronic, and programmable-related systems.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Top Challenges in Industrial Manufacturing and Consumer Electronic Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-top-challenges-in-industrial-manufacturing-and-consumer-electronic-development)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Why Was IEC 61508 Developed?", "level": 3, "content": "The primary goal of the standard is human safety, and it\u2019s based on a couple of principles, including:\n\n1: Use of a safety lifecycle. The lifecycle outlines the best practices around identifying risks and mitigating potential design errors.\n\n2: Probable failure exercises. This assumes that if a device does fail, a \u201cfail-safe\u201d plan is needed.\n\nIEC 61508 applies to all industries; however, even though it covers a broad range of sectors, every industry has its own nuances. As a result, many have developed their own standards based on IEC 61508.\n\nIndustry-specific functional safety standards include ones for:\n\nThe standard includes Safety Integrity Levels (SILs), which cover four stages from SIL 1 to SIL 4 and indicate whether a safety function is likely to result in a dangerous failure.", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Ready to Find Out More?", "level": 3, "content": "Our team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Even if it\u2019s not mandatory, achieving certification provides peace of mind and creates a clear path to improving safety. Certification is offered through international agencies specializing in IEC 61508, such as the [T\u00dcV S\u00dcD](https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us/services/functional-safety/about). Completing certification provides creditability around your IEC 61508 compliance and is a point of differentiation if bidding on a contract against multiple contractors.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae for Robotics Datasheet](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect-for-robotics-datasheet)", "cross_references": []}, {"heading": "Hazard and Risk Analysis for Determining SIL", "level": 3, "content": "Understanding functional safety requires a hazard analysis and risk assessment of the equipment under control (EUC).\n\nThe hazard analysis identifies all possible hazards of a product, process, or application.

Risk Assessment and Mitigation\n\nIndustrial manufacturing orgs must conduct thorough [risk assessments](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/risk-management/) to identify potential hazards in design and functionality for robotics. ISO 10218 provides guidelines for implementing protective measures such as emergency stop functions, safety-rated soft limits, and collision detection, just to name a few.\n\n#### 2. Protective Measures and Safeguarding\n\nThe standard mandates the use of protective enclosures, barriers, and interlock systems (among other provisions) to prevent unintended or negative human-robot interactions. Advanced technologies, e.g., laser scanners and safety-rated sensors, enhance compliance with these requirements.\n\n#### 3. Collaborative Robot (AKA Cobot) Safety\n\nWith the rise of collaborative robots (referred to sometimes as cobots), the safety standard includes provisions for safe human-robot interaction. These include power and force limitations, speed monitoring, and hand-guided control mechanisms to minimize injury risks, among a list of others.\n\n#### 4. Integration and Installation Compliance\n\nPart of ISO 10218-2 details a lot of guidelines around proper installation and integration of robots into industrial environments.\n\nThis includes:\n\n- Ensuring safe robot programming and control systems\n- Implementing functional safety measures\n- Conducting periodic safety inspections and maintenance\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae for Robotics Datasheet](https://www.jamasoftware.com/datasheet/jama-connect-for-robotics-datasheet)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Some, but not all, countries require that robots comply with ISO 10218-1 or the equivalent national standard.\n\n*So, if not mandatory, why are the worlds\u2019 leading organizations choosing to comply with ISO 10218? *\n\n#### 1. Regulatory Compliance and Legal Requirements\n\nAdhering to ISO 10218 helps manufacturers comply with regional and international regulations, such as ISO 12100 (general safety principles) and ISO 13849 (safety-related control systems). Non-compliance can lead to legal liabilities, fines, or operational shutdowns.\n\n#### 2. Enhanced Workplace Safety\n\nImplementing ISO 10218 standards minimizes the risk of workplace accidents and injuries. This fosters a safer work environment and enhances productivity by reducing downtime caused by safety incidents.\n\n#### 3. Improved Marketability and Customer Trust\n\nCompliance with ISO 10218 demonstrates a company\u2019s commitment to safety and quality, making their robotic solutions more attractive to global markets.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [The Top Challenges in Industrial Manufacturing and Consumer Electronic Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/blog/the-top-challenges-in-industrial-manufacturing-and-consumer-electronic-development)\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs [industrial robotics](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solutions/industrial-manufacturing-machinery-consumer-electronics-energy/) continue to evolve, **ISO 10218** remains a cornerstone of robotic safety. By adhering to its guidelines, manufacturers can ensure safe automation, protect workers, and maintain compliance with international safety regulations. Whether designing new robotic systems or integrating them into existing workflows, understanding and implementing ISO 10218 is essential for achieving a safer, more efficient industrial environment.\n\n*Note: This article was drafted with the aid of AI.

One of the most groundbreaking developments in recent years is the rise of chiplets, a modular approach to building semiconductors. This new technology is revolutionizing chip design, allowing manufacturers to overcome traditional limitations and pave the way for more advanced and customizable solutions.\n\n### What Are Chiplets?\n\n![A graph made up of different pipes showing how efficiency, customization, scalability, and cost-effectiveness make up overall chiplets technology.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/01/Chiplets-in-Semiconductor.png)\n\nAt their core, chiplets are small, modular semiconductor components that can be combined to form a complete system-on-chip (SoC). Unlike traditional monolithic chip designs, where a single large chip is built from scratch, chiplet technology allows different parts of the chip to be designed and manufactured separately. These individual components can then be connected together using advanced packaging techniques to create a more efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution.\n\nBy breaking the chip into modular sections, companies can reuse proven designs and focus on optimizing specific aspects of the chip, such as processing power, memory, or connectivity. This flexibility is a game-changer for industries that rely on high-performance computing, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and cloud computing.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Buyer\u2019s Guide: Selecting a Requirements Management and Traceability Solution for Automotive](https://www.jamasoftware.com/ebook/your-guide-to-selecting-an-automotive-development-platform)\n\n### Advantages of Chiplet Technology\n\n1. **Customization and Flexibility \u2013** With chiplets, manufacturers can tailor chips to meet the exact needs of their customers. Instead of designing an entirely new chip for every application, they can mix and match different chiplets to create a solution optimized for performance, power efficiency, or specific functionalities.\n2. **Faster Time to Market \u2013** Traditional semiconductor manufacturing can be time-consuming and costly. However, with modular semiconductors, companies can streamline development by leveraging pre-designed components. This speeds up production, reduces research and development costs, and allows for quicker updates and improvements.\n3. **Cost Efficiency \u2013** Producing large, monolithic chips can result in higher production costs due to defects or inefficiencies during the manufacturing process. By using chiplets, manufacturers can isolate any issues to a single module, reducing the overall risk and improving yields. This approach is especially beneficial as we push the boundaries of advanced nodes and transistor scaling.\n4. **Improved Performance \u2013** As semiconductor companies face increasing challenges in scaling down transistors, chiplet-based design offers a way to continue improving performance without needing to rely solely on shrinking individual components. By combining chiplets optimized for different tasks, manufacturers can create a more powerful and efficient chip than a traditional design.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Jama Connect\u00ae for Automotive Datasheet](https://www.jamasoftware.com/solution-overview/jama-connect-for-automotive-solution-overview)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

Building on that foundation, this post explores the application of the digital thread within semiconductor design \u2014 a field where the stakes are high and the need for integration has not only emerged as a strategic differentiator; but well\u2026 a requirement.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is at another crossroads, again. As Integrated Circuits (ICs) become increasingly advanced, the design process continues to grow more complex. Engineers and product teams wrestle with challenges ranging from ensuring power efficiency, manufacturability, meeting time-to-market demands, integrating diverse IP blocks, and adhering to stringent functional safety and cybersecurity standards. Within these challenges lie opportunities for those who adapt and innovate.\n\n### The Digital Thread: Connecting the Design Lifecycle\n\n![Wheel of interlocking pieces representing the integration of a Digital Thread with Digital Engineering for semiconductor design.](https://www.jamasoftware.com/media/2025/02/Semiconductor-1030x286.jpg)\n\nOne of the most pressing issues facing semiconductor companies today is how to architect and deploy seamless software integration across the entire design lifecycle. Best-in-breed software tools are common within certain pockets of the IC development flow. The EDA titans do a great job on the front end of the design cycle and help their users create a firm handshake between a designer and their foundry and fabrication partners. However, end-to-end integration across the entire product development lifecycle continues to be highly sought after, but oftentimes difficult to obtain.\n\nFrom initial requirements through design, simulation, verification, post-silicon validation, and production \u2013 the concept of the digital thread ensures that both internal and external stakeholders have access to a single source of truth for design and test information.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [How to Manage Cybersecurity in Jama Connect\u00ae for Automotive and Semiconductor Industries](https://www.jamasoftware.com/whitepaper/how-to-manage-cybersecurity-in-jama-connect-for-automotive-and-semiconductor-industries)\n\n### The Role of EDA in Chip Design\n\nElectronic Design Automation (EDA) tools are essential for managing the growing complexity of semiconductor design. They enable designers to automate time-consuming and error-prone tasks involved in chip design, such as synthesis, verification, and physical design.\n\nWhen EDA tools become integrated with the digital thread, it unlocks the capability for front-end design data to flow seamlessly with the middle and latter stages of development; from concept to final tape-out. This EDA tool/digital thread integration not only improves efficiency but also enhances collaboration between different teams, reduces the likelihood of design errors leading to costly response, and ensures that ICs are ready for production faster.\n\nThe digital thread helps semiconductor teams manage the increasing complexity of chip design by providing a holistic view of the entire product lifecycle. Advanced process nodes introduce new constraints, including challenges related to thermal management, signal integrity, and power consumption. Design houses must manage these competing priorities with a robust design process while trying to ensure that nothing falls through the cracks. Even with the best processes and prioritization methods from the leading fabless chip designers and Integrated Device Manufacturers \u2013 there are often gaps.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [Leading Quantum Computing Company, IonQ, Selects Jama Connect\u00ae to Decrease Review Cycles, Reduce Rework](https://www.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/leading-quantum-computing-company-ionq-selects-jama-connect)\n\n### Ready to Find Out More?\n\nOur team of experts is here to answer any questions and learn how we can help enable your continued success.

The digital thread and a \u201csingle source of truth\u201d are at the core of this [transformation](https://www.jamasoftware.com/webinar/enabling-digital-transformation-in-the-semiconductor-and-hardware-space), providing continuous connectivity that bridges requirements throughout design, verification, and validation. Designers adopting these approaches are finding they can pivot more easily to implement design changes and minimize rework, resulting in measurable cost savings and faster development cycles.\n\n### Managing Requirements Effectively\n\nRequirements management has become a critical success factor in semiconductor design. As designs grow more complex, so do the needs and specifications they must meet. A robust [requirements management solution](https://www.jamasoftware.com/customer-story), integrated into the digital thread, helps ensure every requirement is tracked from conception through to production, allowing engineers to maintain clear visibility into design intent. Moving away from spreadsheets and adopting requirements management tools that are purpose-built for the semiconductor industry reduces errors, streamlines collaboration, and enables folks to produce better products.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: [FORT Robotics Selects Jama Connect\u00ae to Replace Google Sheets for Product Development](https://www.jamasoftware.com/customer-story/fort-robotics-selects-jama-connect-to-replace-google-sheets-for-product-development)\n\n### Opportunities in a Shifting Landscape\n\nSemiconductor design is a dog-eat-dog world and not for the faint of heart. Technological advancements \u2014 such as the adoption of AI in design automation, the exploration of new materials, and advanced packaging techniques \u2014 are opening new frontiers. But capitalizing on these advancements requires strong foundations: an emphasis on effective communication, adaptable tools, and a focus on managing complexity holistically.\n\nThe digital thread concept is dual purpose and conveniently provides organizations with the foundation needed to monetize tangential opportunities around generative AI, data lake and delta lake development, and agential model development for IC design and manufacturing. Pairing digital engineering and digital thread concepts with a modern requirements management system will not only alleviate many current challenges \u2013 but it also builds resilience for future innovations and will help identify and capture currently unrealized revenue streams.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\nThe semiconductor industry is evolving rapidly. Those who embrace new methodologies and tools with end-to-end capabilities are well-positioned to succeed. Adopting a digital engineering approach that marries the concept of a digital thread with a formal requirements management platform is likely a key focus area for your competition.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can analyze text data to extract relevant information, saving time and ensuring that no critical requirements are overlooked.\n- **Intelligent Document Analysis:**\u202fAI can analyze and interpret complex documents, identifying key requirements and relationships between them. This capability allows for more accurate and comprehensive requirements documentation, reducing the risk of misinterpretation and gaps.\n- **Enhanced Traceability and Impact Analysis:\u202f**AI can improve traceability by automatically linking requirements to their corresponding design elements, test cases, and implementation tasks. In the event of a change in requirements, AI can quickly assess the impact on the project, providing valuable insights for decision-making.\n- **Predictive Analytics and Risk Management:\u202f**AI can analyze historical project data to identify patterns and predict potential risks and challenges. By leveraging predictive analytics, organizations can proactively address issues before they escalate, ensuring smoother project execution.\n- **Real-time Collaboration and Feedback:\u202f**AI-powered collaboration tools facilitate real-time communication and feedback among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. These tools can also provide intelligent suggestions and recommendations, enhancing the quality of discussions and decisions.\n- **Continuous Learning and Improvement:**\u202fAI systems can continuously learn from past projects and refine their algorithms, leading to ongoing improvements in requirements management processes. This continuous learning capability ensures that organizations stay ahead of the curve and adapt to evolving project needs.\n\n[Find out more](https://labs.jamasoftware.com/) about the innovative steps Jama Software is taking in the area of NLP and AI for Requirements Management.\n\n*Note: This article was drafted with the aid of AI.
